Introduction

The role of design in election materials

Effective information design—design that is based on usability, clarity, and 

accuracy—is critical to the success of materials and objects whose intent is to 

communicate complicated ideas to the people who use them. As simple 

as highway signs may appear to be, lengthy studies of color, type size and 

arrangement, and materials have been completed to ensure their clarity and ease 

of use. Airport signs rely on similar information design principles to effectively 

communicate to international audiences. The design of an airplane safety 

card is critical; even the design of the nutrition label, now required on all food 

packaging, has helped present complex information clearly and allowed people 

to gain a better understanding of their diet. In these examples, effective 

information design is critical to their success.

Election ofﬁ cials, The Election Assistance Commission (EAC) and the Design 

for Democracy team (as contractor to the EAC) share the same objective in 

terms of developing a means for achieving a voting experience that attracts 

citizens to vote; makes the choice of candidates and issues relatively easy; and 

ensures that voters cast their votes with conﬁ dence that they have made the 

right choice and that it has been registered properly. The beneﬁ t of these 

guidelines for the election ofﬁ cial is that they draw on professional information 

design experience, research, testing, and evaluation to provide examples of 

approaches that are likely to be most successful. To this extent they complement 

and support the challenges election ofﬁ cials face.

1.4

Introduction

Best practices for the design 
of election materials

In 2005, the EAC awarded Design for Democracy (contractor) a research and 

design contract to identify a series of voluntary best practices for voter information 

materials and ballots.

The best practices speciﬁ ed in this document support election reform 

requirements for ballot design and publicly posted voting information—as 

mandated by sections 241(b)(2) and 302(b) of the 2002 Help America Vote Act 

(HAVA). These sections include:

 —

Ballot designs for elections for Federal ofﬁ ce.

 —

Public posting of sample ballots on Election Day.

 —

Public posting of election date and hours on Election Day.

 —

Public posting of voting instructions, including for provisional ballots,

on Election Day.

on Election Day.

 —

Public posting of instructions for ﬁ rst-time voters and mail-in registrants 

 —

Public posting of voting rights, including provisional ballot rights, ofﬁ cial contacts 

for suspected rights violations, and legislative information on misrepresentation 

and fraud on Election Day.

The best practice samples shown in sections 2 through 5 are based on 2005 

Voluntary Voting System Guidelines (VVSG) and Americans with Disabilities Act 

(ADA) guidelines, research ﬁ ndings, and information design principles.

One size does not ﬁ t all when it comes to the electoral process. The U.S. 

Constitution gives the authority to each State to administer elections for its 

citizens. While certain processes may make sense in some States, they may not 

apply in others. The best practice designs recommended in this document offer 

plausible directions for election ofﬁ cials interested in prioritizing voter needs with 

consideration for their local administrative and vendor capabilities. 

Compliance with best practice recommendations by election administrators 

is voluntary.

Solutions in this document support voters capable of interacting with traditional 

inputs. Initial recommendations for further study to support speciﬁ c accessibility 

needs are included with design speciﬁ cations.

1.5

Introduction

High-level recommendations

1   Review best practice materials to gauge their speciﬁ c, local value

Ofﬁ cials and their production teams are encouraged to compare these best practice 

prototypes with their local templates to (1) identify the variances between them, 

(2) determine how new practices could be adopted for use, and (3) create a revised 

election design work plan which might include new contributors, production steps, 

timelines, etc. Planning tables are included in sections 2 through 5 for reference in 

developing a revised work plan.

2   Read and work with best practice templates

The design systems speciﬁ ed in this document offer adaptive ﬂ exibility to election 

ofﬁ cials interested in incorporating them. All design templates are templates—most 

of the included content is variable (sample ballot data are supplied by the National 

Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST)), while design components are to be 

reviewed as a successfully researched set. While some voter information materials 

may already comply with local requirements, election ofﬁ cials should be prepared 

to reﬁ ne and edit templates to accommodate their speciﬁ c needs. All templates are 

available in editable formats for election ofﬁ cials and their design and production 

partners at www.eac.gov.

3   Identify election design contributors

Professional designers and writers with simple-language writing skills are ideally 

suited to help election ofﬁ cials adapt best practice speciﬁ cations for their use. 

Cultural experts and translators are likewise positioned to offer the best production 

advice for including alternate languages. Election ofﬁ cials should recruit these 

resources with deep subject matter knowledge to augment their core team’s 

capabilities.

4   Manage a collaborative workﬂ ow and production process

As mentioned in recommendation 1, the adoption of ballot and voter information 

design best practices relies on clear communication and successful collaboration 

with all production stakeholders—ballot manufacturers, printers, designers, 

writers, legislators, etc. Advanced planning with each resource to identify all goals, 

constraints, and requirements beforehand will support greater implementation 

success during an election.

1.6

Introduction

An election ofﬁ cial’s viewpoint

Redesigning election materials is like the ﬁ rst few steps in a 12-step program. 

First, you have to admit you have a problem. Then, you need to ask for help. 

And you need to act on it.

That’s why the best practices contained within this document are so useful. 

The EAC took the guesswork out of how to improve election materials. 

With these design templates elections ofﬁ cials can use them easily, including 

modifying language to meet local requirements, and follow good design principles.

Introduction

Methodology

To meet the requirements of the project, the development team followed an 
iterative research-design-evaluate process focused on gathering qualitative data 
from three core research audiences (voters, election ofﬁ cials, and subject matter 
experts with accessibility and/or election backgrounds) to collect ﬁ ndings, design 
best practice prototypes, and draft speciﬁ cations.

Input from manufacturers of voting technologies was also sought—ultimately, 
collaboration with just one national vendor, Election Systems & Software (ES&S), 
was provided in the context of a 2006 General Election pilot study the contractor 
conducted in Nebraska (see Research report, section 6). Without partnering 
directly with voting manufacturers, best practice recommendations are limited 
to interface design solutions—audio design and physical design solutions, 
speciﬁ cally, are not addressed for audiences requiring them.

Data from the project’s nine formal research events are documented in the section 
7 Research report. In summary, the range of research activities included:

 —

 In 2006, the contract team observed primary elections in two 

Observing elections.
New Jersey jurisdictions (rural and urban). They also observed general elections 
in two of Nebraska’s rural counties while pilot testing localized optical scan ballots 
and voter information prototypes.

 —

Conducting ﬁ eld interviews.

and election staff at primary and general elections also informed our decisions.

 Conversations were conducted with election ofﬁ cials 

 —

 Input from a variety of language, literacy, usability, 

Consulting experts.
accessibility, and production experts representing a range of voter interests was 
collected. Election ofﬁ cials with both State and local responsibilities representing 
populations diverse in culture, language, population density, and income were 
interviewed. For production insights, the research team contacted the largest 
domestic manufacturers of commonly used election equipment. Alternate 
language studies addressed usability and readability needs for single- and dual-
language prototypes.

 —

Reviewing legacy and in-use materials.
 Ballot examples from the United States 
and overseas were studied to understand how common challenges, particularly 
low-literacy issues, are addressed.

 —

Conducting usability evaluations.

Introduction

How to use this document

Samples and templates
The best practice samples for the design of ballots and voter information materials 
can be found in sections 2 through 5. Election ofﬁ cials should refer to the table of 
contents for a detailed list. 

Each of these sections contains samples of best practice designs and written 
speciﬁ cations to enable an information designer to recreate them without the use 
of templates, although digital ﬁ les for all samples can be downloaded at www.eac.
gov. These ﬁ les exist in two formats: (1) a noneditable Acrobat PDF format, and (2) 
an Adobe InDesign template that can be updated by an information designer.*

Instructions on how to work with the digital ﬁ les are provided in each section. 

Election ofﬁ cials are encouraged to partner with their vendors and production 
team to review the voluntary design recommendations in this document, which 
produce election materials that support HAVA and 2005 Voluntary Voting System 
Guidelines (VVSG).

Research
Detailed research reports can be found in sections 6 and 7. Section 6 details a pilot 
test of the optical scan ballot and voter information materials. Section 7 details the 
usability testing and research supporting the design of all samples. 

*The EAC does not endorse any speciﬁ c product or vendor. The best practices illustrated 

throughout this document do not rely on speciﬁ c software, products, or vendors. For copyright 
reasons, the EAC cannot supply election ofﬁ cials with the fonts used in the InDesign ﬁ les. 
They are available from numerous suppliers.

Voter information

Voter information

This section has three parts: (1) planning process information; (2) illustrations 
of one-language voter information design best practices; and (3) illustrations of 
two-language voter information design best practices. 

Planning 
The Planning section (pages 2.4–2.7) outlines how to incorporate resources into 
the voter information development and production process; in what areas those 
resources may be of assistance; and when those activities should occur. Also 
included is a production table listing all the voter information materials by name, 
item ID number, those that are required by the 2002 Help America Vote Act 
(HAVA), estimated costs and production times, and which production methods 
and materials are “greener.”

Design 
Best practices are illustrated for both one-language (page 2.8) and two-
language materials (page 2.32). These samples are accompanied by production 
speciﬁcations and discussion notes. 

Electronic versions of these ﬁles are available at www.eac.gov, and speciﬁ c 
instructions on how to use the electronic ﬁ les are included on pages 2.8 and 2.32. 
The electronic ﬁ les are available in two formats, one of which can be edited. 

Election ofﬁ cials are encouraged to partner with their vendors and production 
partners to review the voluntary design recommendations in this document as 
early as possible in their planning activities.

Voter information audience
This section details solutions for voters able to use standard printed materials. 
Content, written in simple language, supports comprehension by voters at a third-
grade reading level. 

These best practices support 2005 Voluntary Voter System Guidelines (VVSG) and 
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements for temporary displays.

Important areas of further study include voter information solutions for alternative 
technologies.

2.3

Voter information

Suggestions for best practices
The general election voter information prototypes shown on the following pages 
are based on 2005 Voluntary Voting System Guidelines (VVSG), Americans 
with Disabilities Act (ADA) guidelines, research ﬁ ndings, and information design 
principles. 

 —

Emphasize voter needs over administrative and vendor requirements. 

 —

Use simple language for all content. Studies show that clear and concise writing 
is beneﬁ cial to voters of all literacy levels. Rewriting ballot instructions and voter 
information materials using simple language increases usability and, on the voter’s 
behalf, accuracy. 

 —

Use one language per item. To meet usability standards, display no more than two 
languages simultaneously.

 —

Use upper- and lowercase sans serif type, set left aligned at the sizes outlined in 
the speciﬁ cations, for readability. Avoid setting text in a centered alignment. Avoid 
setting text in all capital letters. Minimize the number of fonts used. 

 —

Use color functionally to emphasize important information and processes. The use 
of color cannot be the sole means of conveying information or making distinctions. 
Another non color mode must complement color use, such as contrast, icon, text 
style, etc. (see VVSG).

 —

When clarifying instructions and processes, use accurate diagrams to describe 
voting technology and equipment. 

 —

Use instructional icons only. Universally recognized icons such as arrows are 
acceptable and encouraged.

Research ﬁndings 
Detailed ﬁndings that support voter information design best practices can be 
found in section 6 and section 7. 

2.4

Voter information

Planning process

The planning table on the following page outlines additional resources and steps that 
can be taken to ensure that ballot content and design best address voter needs.

Planning goals
These additional resources can help ensure that:

 —

Content is easily understood by voters, including those with low vision and literacy 
issues.

 —

The visual organization and presentation of the content supports ease of use and 
conﬁ dence in the process.

 —

Any necessary translations are accurate and sensitive to cultural differences in 
language and expression.

Planning value by role/resource (page 2.5)

S — imple-language expert ensures that instructions and other ballot content are 

written in the most effective manner to help all voters (not just low-literacy voters) 
understand and follow instructions, and feel conﬁdent that they have properly cast 
their ballots.

 —

Information designer
 organizes the ballot content—text, graphics, illustrations— 
in a manner that is clear, simple, and functional, and that supports and enhances 
the voter’s comprehension of the content and voting process. (Note: The design 
ﬁeld is very broad; it is important to work with a designer who has expertise in the 
organization and presentation of complex information.) 

 —

works with the information designer to develop review, testing, 

Usability expert 
and revision processes that improve the overall effectiveness, accuracy, and 
usability of materials.

 —

Translator
 ensures proper grammatical, syntactic, and structural character of the 
content, and appropriate use of local dialect variations. Accurate translations are 
vital for non-English-speaking voters. Using online translations can be misleading, 
unclear, or simply wrong (for Spanish translations, see the Election Assistance 
Commission (EAC) document “Glossary of Key Election Terminology, English-
Spanish, 2007”).

 —

Cultural expert
and culturally relevant, and that their visual presentation is appropriate.

 reviews translated material to ensure that translations are accurate 

Production planning table (pages 2.6–2.7)
This table provides decision support for the production of voter information 
materials by election ofﬁ cials. The complete voter information system has been 
organized vertically by production format (banners, table signs, etc.). Printing 
decisions, running horizontally at top, provide managers with a planning and 
execution framework.

More sustainable, or “green” reproduction options are color-coded ( 
may be more ﬁ nancially advantageous than less sustainable solutions for a given 
jurisdiction. Cost, process, fabrication and production schedules, and storage data 
were provided by vendors and manufacturers.

 ). They 

Production time/cost requirements cited are used as examples. Election ofﬁ cials 
will need to request and negotiate actual estimates with their vendors.

Simultaneously hire a designer and a usability 
professional who can offer additional feedback.

Partner with a policy advisor who can help guide 
design improvements through the necessary 
legislative processes.

Whenever possible, hire a local person who will 
be able to meet with ofﬁ cials and the extended 
production team (vendors, printers, etc.).

Provide the designer with poll worker training, as 
well as any feedback from voters or poll workers.

Provide the designer with a complete list of current
election documents and legal requirements.

2.8 Voter information

Design: one language

The samples on pages 2.10–2.31 are for voter information materials. Production 
speciﬁ cations and discussion notes are provided—including typeface, type size, 
leading, line weights, tint ﬁ lls, and distances between elements.

Voter information materials are presented in the following categories:

A  Identiﬁ cation 

B  Wayﬁ nding (e.g., directions to accessible entrances)

C  Information and Instruction

These categories are offered to help election ofﬁ cials understand what is available 
and to help them determine which items and formats best suit their needs. 

Electronic ﬁles 
The electronic ﬁ les that were used to create these samples are listed in this 
section’s Overview (pages 2.10–2.11) and with each sample.

The electronic ﬁ les are available at www.eac.gov.

They are provided in two formats: Acrobat (.pdf) and InDesign (.indd).*

Each item has a unique identiﬁ cation number and ﬁ le name. For example, 
the English-language information poster Acrobat ﬁ le is named “130_E_Info.pdf.”

How to work with the samples and electronic ﬁ les
Many of the samples illustrated in this section can be reproduced and used 
without making any text changes to the digital document ﬁ le. They can be printed 
by an ofﬁ ce printer with color capabilities, or, for the larger format items, be 
reproduced by a vendor with digital printing capabilities. 

 —

If there are no changes to an item, download the Acrobat ﬁ le. 
ends in ”.pdf”. For example, to reproduce the Information poster (item “130_E_Info,” 
page 2.44), download and print out the Acrobat ﬁ le (130_E_Info.pdf) or supply that 
ﬁ le to a vendor with digital printing capabilities. 

An Acrobat ﬁ le always 

Local vendors with digital printing capabilities often include printing ﬁ rms and 
copy and duplicating service shops. “Digital printing capabilities” means they can 
accept a digital ﬁ le and “output” it or print it on an appropriate display material 
(see pages 2.6–2.7). “Digital printing” often means ink jet printing. Even traditional 
“copy shops” often now have digital output capabilities.

 —

If changes need to be made to an item, download the Indesign ﬁ le.
 InDesign ﬁ les 
end with “.indd.” Much of the text used in this section’s samples may or may not 
be appropriate for any given jurisdiction and/or the voting equipment. Illustrations 
used in the InDesign ﬁ les may also be modiﬁ ed—the ﬁ le names end in “.eps.”

*The EAC does not endorse any speciﬁ c product or vendor. The best practices illustrated 

throughout this document do not rely on speciﬁ c software, products, or vendors. For copyright 
reasons, the EAC cannot supply election ofﬁ cials with the fonts used in the InDesign ﬁ les. 
They are available from numerous suppliers.

2.9

Voter information

Design

One language

To edit ﬁ les ending with “.indd” or ﬁ les ending in “.eps,” election ofﬁ cials will need 
access to Adobe InDesign page layout software and to software that can edit 
.eps ﬁ les (e.g., Adobe Illustrator). Working with a designer who has access 
to—and expertise in—these software programs is recommended.

Alternatively, these items can be recreated in other page layout programs using 
the production speciﬁ cations provided with each sample; the Acrobat .pdf ﬁ les as 
a visual guide; and, if appropriate, the illustration ﬁ les provided (those ﬁ les ending 
in .eps). Using nonlayout programs, such as those commonly used to write 
text-only documents, is not appropriate or recommended. 

Use of color
Many of the samples use the colors “blue” and “red”; in all cases, the CMYK ink 
percentages of these colors are:

Blue: 89% cyan, 43% magenta, 0% yellow, and 0% black.
Red: 0% cyan, 94% magenta, 100% yellow, and 0% black.

Color has been applied to voter information materials to support usability needs—
not for decorative purposes. Replacing blue or red with black does not affect any 
piece’s functional value. Guidance in limiting color quantity (one to two colors) 
and application (mainly in headers, labels, and icons) is intended to maximize its 

effectiveness in the polling place environment.

U.S. Department of Justice
Civil Rights Division–Voting Section
 

The Voting Rights Act of 1965 protects every American against 
racial discrimination in voting. This law also protects the 
voting rights of many people who have limited English skills. 
It stands for the principle that everyone’s vote is equal, and 
that neither race nor language should shut any of us out of the 
political process. The Voting Rights Act made these and other 
discriminatory practices illegal, and gave private citizens the 
right to sue in federal court to stop them. In recent times, courts 
have applied the Act to end race discrimination in the method 
of electing state and local legislative bodies and in the choosing 
of poll ofﬁ cials. You can ﬁ nd the Voting Rights Act in the United 
States Code at 42 U.S.C. 1973 to 1973aa-6.

First-time voters: how to vote

1.  Give your name to the poll worker.

2. Sign your name in the register. If you are unable to write, 
 

the poll worker can help you make a mark. 

3. Mark your ballots in the polling booth.

4. Fold your ballot so that your marks are not seen. 

5. Put your ballot in the envelope or sleeve so that the poll worker’s 
 

initials show. 

6. Return the ballot envelope or sleeve to the poll worker. 
  The poll worker will put the ballot in the ballot box.

Notice to physically disabled voters

If you cannot read, or if you need help to mark your ballot because 
of disability, a relative or friend can help you. 

If you know someone who cannot enter the polling station because 
of a disability, tell the poll worker. The ballot may be taken to the 
voter, either to a more convenient place in the building or to the 
voter’s car parked within one block. 

Acts of fraud or misrepresentation

 

It is a felony to commit an election falsiﬁ cation. That includes:

•  Pretending to be a voter,

•  Falsely swearing to be a member of a political party,

•  Interfering with the polling place,

•  Voting more than once each election, and more.

  For a complete list of the Nebraska’s Voting Violations and Penalties, 
  please ask a poll worker.

  Smoking is not permitted in the polling place.

Rules for voters who registered by mail

Voters who have registered to vote by mail—and never conﬁ rmed their 
identity to a registrar, election commissioner or polling ofﬁ cial before— 
must show identiﬁ cation before receiving a ballot. 

You may use any of these documents for identiﬁ cation:

•  A valid Driver’s License or other ID with your photo and name on it 

•  Another document that shows your name and address, including 
  a pay check, government check, current utility bill, or any federal, 
  state, or local government document.

  You do not have to show this identiﬁ cation if you are:

•  A military or overseas voter 

•  Over the age of 65 

•  A voter with a disability and are voting in a different location from 
  the one where you are registered. 

Voting by provisional ballot  

If your name is not on the voter registration list OR 
If you cannot show ID:

1. Fill out a voter registration application. 

2. Fill out and sign the provisional ballot envelope. 

3. Select a PIN number.

4. Place your voted ballots in the envelope.

After the polls close

Your registration will be conﬁ rmed before the envelope is opened 
and your ballot is counted. 

Beginning 8 days after the election, you may check to see if your ballot 
was counted. Call 1-888-727-0007 or check votercheck.necvr.ne.gov.

U.S. Department of Justice
Civil Rights Division–Voting Section
 

The Voting Rights Act of 1965 protects every American against 
racial discrimination in voting. This law also protects the 
voting rights of many people who have limited English skills. 
It stands for the principle that everyone’s vote is equal, and 
that neither race nor language should shut any of us out of the 
political process. The Voting Rights Act made these and other 
discriminatory practices illegal, and gave private citizens the 
right to sue in federal court to stop them. In recent times, courts 
have applied the Act to end race discrimination in the method 
of electing state and local legislative bodies and in the choosing 
of poll ofﬁ cials. You can ﬁ nd the Voting Rights Act in the United 
States Code at 42 U.S.C. 1973 to 1973aa-6.

2.32 Voter information

Design: two languages

The samples on pages 2.34–2.55 are for voter information materials. Production 
speciﬁ cations and discussion notes are provided—including typeface, type size, 
leading, line weights, tint ﬁ lls, and distances between elements.

Voter information materials are presented in the following categories:

A  Identiﬁ cation 

B  Wayﬁ nding (e.g., directions to accessible entrances)

C  Information and Instruction

These categories are offered to help election ofﬁ cials understand what is available 
and to help them determine which items and formats best suit their needs. 

Electronic ﬁles 
The electronic ﬁ les that were used to create these samples are listed in this 
section’s Overview (pages 2.34–2.35) and with each sample.

The electronic ﬁ les are available at www.eac.gov.

They are provided in two formats: Acrobat (.pdf) and InDesign (.indd).*

Each item has a unique identiﬁ cation number and ﬁ le name. For example, 
the English/Spanish-language information poster Acrobat ﬁ le is named
“130_ES_Info.pdf.”

How to work with the samples and electronic ﬁ les
Many of the samples illustrated in this section can be reproduced and used 
without making any text changes to the digital document ﬁ le. They can be printed 
by an ofﬁ ce printer with color capabilities, or, for the larger format items, be 
reproduced by a vendor with digital printing capabilities. 

 —

If there are no changes to an item, download the Acrobat ﬁ le. 
ends in ”.pdf.” For example, if you want to reproduce the Information poster (item 
“130_ES_Info,” page 2.44), download and print out the Acrobat ﬁ le (130_ES_Info.
pdf) or supply that ﬁ le to a vendor with digital printing capabilities. 

An Acrobat ﬁ le always 

Local vendors with digital printing capabilities often include printing ﬁ rms and 
copy and duplicating service shops. “Digital printing capabilities” means they can 
accept a digital ﬁ le and “output” it or print it on an appropriate display material 
(see pages 2.6–2.7). “Digital printing” often means ink jet printing. Even traditional 
“copy shops” often now have digital output capabilities.

 —

If changes need be made to an item, download the Indesign ﬁ le.
end with “.indd.” Much of the text used in this section’s samples may or may 
not be appropriate for your jurisdiction and/or the voting equipment. To edit text 
or illustrations and prepare ﬁ les for reproduction, there are additional steps that 
must occur before the materials are ready for reproduction. Illustrations used in the 
InDesign ﬁ les are also available. These ﬁ les end with “.eps.”

 InDesign ﬁ les 

*The EAC does not endorse any speciﬁ c product or vendor. The best practices illustrated 

throughout this document do not rely on speciﬁ c software, products, or vendors. For copyright 
reasons, the EAC cannot supply election ofﬁ cials with the fonts used in the InDesign ﬁ les. 
They are available from numerous suppliers.

2.33

Voter information

Design

Two languages

To edit ﬁ les ending with “.indd” or ﬁ les ending in “.eps,” election ofﬁ cials will need 
access to Adobe InDesign page layout software and to software that can edit .eps 
ﬁ les (e.g., Adobe Illustrator). Working with a designer who has access to—and 
expertise in—these software programs is recommended.

Alternatively, these items can be recreated in other page layout programs using 
the production speciﬁ cations provided with each sample; the Acrobat .pdf ﬁ les as 
a visual guide; and, if appropriate, the illustration ﬁ les provided (those ﬁ les ending 
in .eps). Using nonlayout programs, such as those commonly used to write 
text-only documents, is not appropriate or recommended. 

Use of color
Many of the samples use the colors “blue” and “red”; in all cases, the CMYK ink 
percentages of these colors are:

Blue: 89% cyan, 43% magenta, 0% yellow, and 0% black.
Red: 0% cyan, 94% magenta, 100% yellow, and 0% black.

Color has been applied to voter information materials to support usability needs—
not for decorative purposes. Replacing blue or red with black does not affect any 
piece’s functional value. Guidance in limiting color quantity (one to two colors) 
and application (mainly in headers, labels, and icons) is intended to maximize its 

effectiveness in the polling place environment.

Departamento de Justicia de los E.E.U.U.
División de Derechos Civiles – Sección Electoral

La Ley del Derecho al Voto de 1965 protege a todos los 
estadounidenses de el discrimen racial. Esta ley también protege 
los derechos electorales de personas con destrezas limitadas 
en el idioma inglés. El principio fundamental es que el sufragio 
de todos es igual, y que ni la raza ni la lengua deben ser un 
obstáculo para que seamos parte del proceso electoral. La 
Ley del Derecho al Voto establece que estas y otras prácticas 
discriminatorias son ilegales, y le otorga a los ciudadanos civiles 
el derecho de iniciar litigios ante el tribunal federal para detener 
dichas prácticas. Recientemente los tribunales han aplicado esta 
ley para eliminar el discrimen racial en los métodos de elección 
para los organismos legislativos locales y estatales y en la 
elección de los trabajadors electorales. Puede encontrar La Ley 
del Derecho al Voto en el Código de los Estados Unidos de Norte 
América, 42 U.S.C. 1973 a 1973aa-6.

Departamento de Justicia de los E.E.U.U.
División de Derechos Civiles – Sección Electoral

La Ley del Derecho al Voto de 1965 protege a todos los 
estadounidenses de el discrimen racial. Esta ley también protege 
los derechos electorales de personas con destrezas limitadas 
en el idioma inglés. El principio fundamental es que el sufragio 
de todos es igual, y que ni la raza ni la lengua deben ser un 
obstáculo para que seamos parte del proceso electoral. La 
Ley del Derecho al Voto establece que estas y otras prácticas 
discriminatorias son ilegales, y le otorga a los ciudadanos civiles 
el derecho de iniciar litigios ante el tribunal federal para detener 
dichas prácticas. Recientemente los tribunales han aplicado esta 
ley para eliminar el discrimen racial en los métodos de elección 
para los organismos legislativos locales y estatales y en la 
elección de los trabajadors electorales. Puede encontrar La Ley 
del Derecho al Voto en el Código de los Estados Unidos de Norte

three-ring binder.

This format is a full-text version of the poster format 
(page 2.49).

Content needs to be modiﬁ ed for each State. 
The content in this instance pertains speciﬁ cally to 
Nebraska law. Election ofﬁ cials will have to download 
the editable version of this template (.indd) to edit 
the text for consistency with the requirements of 
their State.

Binders are suggested to display the full text of legally 
required State information that is not easily contained 
or read in a wall display format by voters (such as 
voters’ rights information). Binders can also be 
used to display other redundant information already 
posted in the polling environment, such as voting 
instructions.

Some races allow votes for more than 
one person; the number appears just 
below the name of the ofﬁ ce. Make sure 
you do not mark more votes than that 
number. You may choose to vote for 
fewer, or you can skip any race.

If a ballot contains too many votes in 
one race, votes for that race will not 
be counted. The other correct races 
will be counted.

Review your ballot

(cid:5140)(cid:1931)(cid:2738)(cid:1669)(cid:5019)(cid:2927)

Before you place your ballot into the 
ballot box or scanner, double-check 
your votes.  

Some races allow votes for more than 
one person; the number appears just 
below the name of the ofﬁ ce. Make sure 
you do not mark more votes than that 
number. You may choose to vote for 
fewer, or you can skip any race.

If a ballot contains too many votes in 
one race, votes for that race will not 
be counted. The other correct races 
will be counted.

Effective Designs for the
Administration of Federal Elections

Section 3: Optical scan ballots

June 2007

U.S. Election Assistance Commission

3.2

Optical scan ballots

Optical scan ballots

This section has three parts: (1) planning process information; (2) one-language 
ballot design best practices and samples; and (3) two-language ballot design best 
practices and samples.

Planning 
The Planning section (pages 3.4–3.5) outlines how to incorporate resources 
into your ballot development and production process; in what areas those 
resources may be of assistance; and when those activities should occur. It also 
offers tips on possible challenges and opportunities. These suggestions apply 
to both one-language and two-language ballots.

Design 
For both one-language (page 3.6) and two-language ballots (page 3.34), best 
practice samples are illustrated in full and by component. These components and 
samples are accompanied by production speciﬁcations and discussion notes. 

Samples 
Samples of the design best practices and components are applied to the various 
one-language ballots (page 3.22) and various two-language ballots (page 3.50). 
The variations include two ballot styles: a one-color version and a Chinese-
language version. 

Electronic versions of these ﬁles are available at www.eac.gov, and speciﬁ c 
instructions on how to use the electronic ﬁ les are included on pages 3.22 and 
3.50. The electronic ﬁ les are available in two formats, one of which can be edited. 

Election ofﬁ cials are encouraged to partner with their vendors and production 
partners to review the voluntary design recommendations in this document as 
early as possible.

Translations
The sample Chinese text in this section has been professionally translated, but 
translations do not reﬂ ect a speciﬁ c elections expertise. The translated Spanish 
text has been edited to support election terminology recommended in the EAC’s 
“Glossary of Key Election Terminology, English-Spanish, 2007.” 

Voter audience
This section details solutions for voters able to use printed ballots. Ballot 
instructions, labels, and navigation are written in simple language to support 
comprehension by voters at a third-grade reading level. 

Optical scan speciﬁ cations are based on information design principles, primary 
research ﬁ ndings, and accessibility requirements cited in 2005 Voluntary Voter 
System Guidelines (VVSG) section 3.2. 

Areas of further study
System solutions for alternative input/output variations (combining tactile, 
audio, and visual toolsets) and solutions for large-print ballots.

3.3

Optical scan ballots

Suggestions for best practices
The general election voter information prototypes shown on the following pages 
are based on VVSG, Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) guidelines, research 
ﬁ ndings, and information design principles. 

 —

Emphasize voter needs over administrative and vendor requirements.

 —

Use simple language for all content. Studies show that clear and concise writing is 
beneﬁ cial to voters of all literacy levels. Rewriting instructions, ballot instructions, 
and voter information materials using simple language increases usability and, on 
the voter’s behalf, accuracy. 

 —

Use one language per ballot, which is recommended practice. To meet usability 
standards, display no more than two languages simultaneously.

 —

Use upper- and lowercase sans serif type, set left aligned at the sizes outlined in 
the speciﬁ cations, for readability. Avoid setting text in a centered alignment. Avoid 
setting text in all capital letters. Minimize the number of fonts used. 

 —

Set at a minimum of 12 points all ballot content voters will read. Given a choice 
between adequate type size (12 points) and fewer pages, ballots with 12-point 
type and more pages were found to be more usable than those with fewer pages 
and smaller type.

 —

Use color functionally and consistently. Color can draw the reader’s attention 
and emphasize important information. The use of color cannot be the sole means 
of conveying information or making distinctions. Another noncolor mode must 
complement color use, such as contrast, icon, text style, etc. (see VVSG).

 —

When clarifying instructions and processes, use accurate diagrams to describe 
voting technology and equipment. 

 —

Use instructional icons only. Universally recognized icons such as arrows are 
acceptable and encouraged.

Research ﬁndings 
Detailed ﬁndings that support ballot design best practices can be found in section 
6 and section 7. 

3.4

Optical scan ballots

Planning process

The planning table on the following page outlines additional resources and steps that 
can be taken to ensure that ballot content and design best address voter needs.

These recommendations are based on best practices in use in Cook County, 
Illinois, and the pilot test in Nebraska.

Planning goals
These additional resources can help ensure that:

 —

Content is easily understood by voters, including those with low vision 
and literacy issues.

 —

The visual organization of the content supports ease of use and conﬁ dence in the 
process.

 —

Any necessary translations are accurate and sensitive to cultural differences 
in language and expression.

Planning value by role/resource

S — imple-language expert ensures that instructions and other ballot content are 

written in the most effective manner to help all voters (not just low-literacy voters) 
understand and follow instructions, and feel conﬁ dent that they have properly cast 
their ballots.

 —

 organizes the ballot content—text, graphics, illustrations—in 

Information designer
a manner that is clear, simple, and functional, and that supports and enhances 
the voter’s comprehension of the content and voting process. (Note: The design 
ﬁ eld is very broad; it is important to work with a designer who has expertise in the 
organization and presentation of complex information.) 

 —

Usability expert 
works with the information designer to develop review, testing, 
and revision processes that improve the ballot’s overall effectiveness, accuracy, 
and usability.

 —

Translator
 ensures proper grammatical, syntactic, and structural character of the 
content, and appropriate use of local dialect variations. Accurate translations are 
vital for non-English-speaking voters, and online translations are often misleading, 
unclear, or simply wrong (for Spanish translations, see EAC document “Glossary 
of Key Election Terminology, English-Spanish, 2007”).

 —

Cultural expert 
accurate and culturally relevant, and that their visual presentation is appropriate. 

reviews translated material to ensure that the translations are 

Simultaneously hire a designer and a usability 
professional who can offer additional feedback.

Partner with a policy advisor who can help guide 
design improvements through the necessary 
legislative processes.

Whenever possible, hire a local person who will 
be able to meet with ofﬁ cials and the extended 
production team (vendors, printers, etc.).

Provide the designer with poll worker training, as 
well as any feedback from voters or poll workers.

Provide the designer with a complete list of current
election documents and legal requirements.

3.6 Optical scan ballots

Design: one language

On pages 3.7–3.21, design best practices for a general election one-language 
ballot are illustrated. Production speciﬁ cations and discussion notes are 
provided—including typeface,* type size, leading, line weights, tint ﬁ lls, and 
distances between elements. 

The ballot content used in these samples was originally developed by the National 
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to illustrate a “moderately complex” 
ballot. Although it is impossible to cover every ballot scenario, most general 
election ballot layout issues can be addressed using these designs.

Components 
As illustrated on the following page, an optical scan ballot has four basic 
component content areas:

A  Election information (e.g., jurisdiction, general election, and date) 

B  Ballot instructions

C  Ballot navigation, including page numbers and reminders to vote on the other side 
     or go on to the next page

D  Questions, including contests, retentions, and ballot measures

Each of these components is illustrated at its full size, and production 
speciﬁ cations are included. Speciﬁ cations are numbered from  1  through  6 .

Designers can apply speciﬁ cations in this section to other paper ballot formats, 
such as absentee, emergency, and primary election ballots.

*The EAC does not endorse any speciﬁ c product or vendor. The best practices illustrated 

throughout this document do not rely on speciﬁ c software, products or vendors. For copyright 
reasons, the EAC cannot supply election ofﬁ cials with the fonts used in the InDesign ﬁ les. 
They are available from numerous suppliers.

Election information speciﬁ cations

Discussion 

Though this is important content, it should not 
be set so large that it affects the amount of room 
for instructions and ballot content actually used 
by the voter. 

Information deﬁ ning the speciﬁ cs of the election 
should be placed above the left column of the face 
of every ballot page outside the area used by the 
voter and the scanner. Content should include the 
statement “Ofﬁ cial Ballot” along with election type, 
location, and date. Local laws may require that 
additional information be included.

1

Information
On ballots with space constraints, election 
information may be set at a minimum size. For ballots 
with more available space, larger type is encouraged.

Minimum size type for all: Univers 65 Bold, 
size 10 pt., leading 11 pt., tracking -20, 100% 
black, left aligned.

Maximum size type for title: Univers 65 Bold, 
size 18 pt., leading 20 pt., tracking -20, 100% 
black, left aligned.

Maximum size type for location and date: 
Univers 65 Bold, size 12 pt., leading 14 pt.,

Type: Univers 65 Bold, size 12 pt., leading 13 pt., 
tracking -20, 100% black, left aligned, set 0.1” from 
left edge of ﬁ ll.

4

Illustration
Begins 0.1” below lowest baseline of title.

Size: 0.1” inset from column width on both sides; 
height determined by most effective display of

Type: Univers 45 Light, size 12 pt., leading 15 pt., 
tracking -20, 100% black, left aligned, set 0.1” from 
left edge of ﬁ ll.

Alerts
These should be used only for critical instructions, 
such as actions that may invalidate a voter’s ballot. 
Begins 0.1” below lowest baseline of instruction 
content.

Attention icon: 0.25” diameter, 100% process cyan, 
set 0.1” from left edge of ﬁ ll.

Type: Univers 65 Bold, size 12 pt., leading 15 pt., 
tracking -20, 100% process cyan, left aligned, 
set 0.1” from left edge of ﬁ ll and 0.1” below Attention 
icon.

Discussion

The decision to apply color only to instructions was 
conﬁ rmed by feedback from usability testing and 
literacy experts.

Depending on the printer, paper used, and other 
production variables, the percentages speciﬁ ed 
for ﬁ lls (e.g., 10% process cyan) may need to be 
adjusted. The vendor should provide a test sample for 
review.

Illustrative diagrams that accurately reﬂ ect the ballot 
type and equipment further clarify instructions and 
processes.

These illustrations are available at www.eac.gov.

Informational icons are used to draw attention to 
unique or important areas of the ballot or to improve 
the voter’s ability to scan dense information. 

Embedding ballot instructions in ballots supports 
greater voting focus and autonomy for users, as does 
the use of simple language, numbered steps, and 
clear, speciﬁ c illustrations.

Ballot instructions, running either vertically or 
horizontally, must be self-contained and separated 
from contest data. Vertical instruction treatments 
cannot share column space with contests—test 
voters often overlooked races located immediately 
beneath vertical instructions. Horizontal instructions 
running atop vertically placed contests in columns 
require the voter to read across (instructions) and 
then down-up (contests), which adds a slight learning 
challenge compared to an all-vertical layout.

points (next page) can be used to draw attention to 
unique or important areas of the ballot or to improve 
the voter’s ability to scan dense information.

Contest instructions
This area deﬁ nes each contest’s instructions; it 
begins directly below the header. 

Fill: 10% process cyan, extends full width of the 
column, 0.1” above topmost ascender of type, and 
0.1” below lowest baseline of type.

Discussion

Informational icons such as exclamation points and 
arrows are offered to draw attention to unique or 
important areas of the ballot or to improve the voter’s 
ability to scan dense information.

These informational icons are available at
www.eac.gov. 

The use of political party icons is not encouraged, as 
literacy experts and design professionals believe they 
simply confuse many voters.

The decision to apply color only to instructions was 
conﬁ rmed by feedback from usability testing and 
literacy experts.

Depending on the printer, paper used, and other 
production variables, the percentages speciﬁ ed 
for ﬁ lls (e.g., 10% process cyan) may need to be 
adjusted. The vendor should provide a test sample 
for review.

The phrase “Vote for 1 pair” is recommended best 
practice by simple language experts.

Discussion

A primary voter criticism of ballots is the length 
and complexity of ballot measure questions. It is 
imperative that these questions be written in the 
simplest language possible. Many jurisdictions also 
provide summaries. 

The typesetting of the ballot measure text is critical. 
Too many or too few characters per line inhibit 
legibility and comprehension. The goal should be 40–
60 characters per line. Research indicates that many 
users ﬁ nd line lengths of more than 60 characters or 
less than 20 characters hard to read. 

There is a direct relationship between type size and 
line spacing (leading). Lines of type that are too close 
together inhibit legibility and comprehension (as do 
lines that are too far apart). Ballot measure content 
in these best practices are set at 12 points, with 2 
points of leading.

The decision to apply color only to instructions was 
conﬁ rmed by feedback from usability testing and 
literacy experts.

Depending on the printer, paper used, and other 
production variables, the percentages speciﬁ ed 
for ﬁ lls (e.g., 10% process cyan) may need to be 
adjusted. The vendor should provide a test sample for 
review.

Optical scan ballots

Samples: one language 

Optical scan ballot design best practices are applied to one-language variations on 
pages 3.23–3.33. The variations include two ballot styles, a one-color version and 
an Asian-language version. 

Speciﬁ cations that vary from those outlined previously are included. The samples 
illustrate the ﬂ exibility of the design best practices.

The sample Chinese text in this section has been professionally translated, but 
translations do not reﬂ ect a speciﬁ c elections expertise.

Electronic ﬁles 
The electronic ﬁ les that were used to create these best practices are available at 
www.eac.gov.

They are provided in two formats: Acrobat (.pdf) and InDesign (.indd).*

Each item has a unique identiﬁ cation number and ﬁ le name. For example, 
the Acrobat ﬁ le of the illustration on the next page is “OpScan_1L_VersionA.pdf.”

How to work with the samples and electronic ﬁ les
The Acrobat ﬁ les can be printed on an ofﬁ ce printer (depending on paper size), or 
by a local vendor with digital printing capabilities (printing ﬁ rms and copy shops 
often have digital printing capabilities). Printed versions of these samples will serve 
as an important reference during the ballot design and production process.

InDesign ﬁ les are template ﬁ les that can be edited. The illustrative diagrams used 
in the InDesign ﬁ les are also available at www.eac.gov. These ﬁ les end with 
“.eps” and can also be edited. Access to Adobe InDesign page layout software 
and to software that can edit .eps ﬁ les (e.g., Adobe Illustrator) is necessary. 
Working with a designer who has access to—and expertise in—these software 
programs is recommended.

Alternatively, these items can be recreated in other page layout programs using 
the production speciﬁ cations provided on pages 3.6–3.21; the Acrobat .pdf ﬁ les 
as a visual guide; and, if appropriate, the illustration ﬁ les provided. Using nonlayout 
programs, such as those commonly used to write text-only documents, is not 
appropriate or recommended. 

*The EAC does not endorse any speciﬁ c product or vendor. The best practices illustrated 

throughout this document do not rely on speciﬁ c software, products, or vendors. For copyright 
reasons, the EAC cannot supply election ofﬁ cials with the fonts used in the InDesign ﬁ les. 
They are available from numerous suppliers.

Alterations to the speciﬁ cations noted on pages 
3.8–3.21 are noted below.

Election information 
If space allows, the election information component 
may be made larger so the voter can easily identify 
it. See page 3.9 for more information on this 
component.

Voting instructions
Both text and illustrations of the voting instructions 
should be developed to correspond precisely with 
the details of your particular ballot. See page 3.11 for 
more information about this component.

Variations in selection method
On some ballot types, the selection location is to the 
right of the candidate’s name. In these cases, place 
the selection options 0.1” from the left border of the 
column. 

Ballot navigation
In certain circumstances, navigation instructions may 
not be allowed in “active” or “live” areas of the ballot. 
In these cases, place the instructions as close to the 
bottom of the rightmost column as permitted.

Proposed Constitutional Amendment H: Limit of Damages for Health Care Providers

Vote yes or no

Shall there be an amendment to the State constitution allowing the State legislature to enact laws limiting the amount 
of damages for noneconomic loss that could be awarded for injury or death caused by a health care provider?

“Noneconomic loss” generally includes, but is not limited to, losses such as pain and suffering, inconvenience, mental 
anguish, loss of capacity for enjoyment of life, loss of consortium, and other losses the claimant is entitled to recover 
as damages under general law. This amendment will not in any way affect the recovery of damages for ecomonic 
loss under State law. “Economic loss” generally includes, but is not limited to, monetary losses such as past and 
future medical expenses, loss of past and future earnings, loss of use of property, costs of repair or replacement, the 
economic value of domestic services, loss of employment or business opportunities. This amendment will not in any 
way affect the recovery of any additional damages known under State law as exemplary or punitive damages, which 
are damages allowed by law to punish a defendant and to deter persons from engaging in similar conduct in the future.

Proposed Constitutional Amendment K: Slot Machines in Madison/Fromwit Counties

Vote yes or no

Shall there be an amendment to the State constitution authorizing Madison and Fromwit Counties to hold referenda 
on whether to authorize slot machines in existing, licensed parimutuel facilities (thoroughbred and harness racing, 
greyhound racing, and jai alai) that have conducted live racing or games in that county during each of the last two 
calendar years before effective date of this amendment?

The Legislature may tax slot machine revenues, and any such taxes must supplement public education funding 
statewide. Requires implementing legislation. This amendment alone has no ﬁ scal impact on government. If slot 
machines are authorized in Madison or Fromwit counties, governmental costs associated with additional gambling 
will increase by an unknown amount and local sales tax-related revenues will be reduced by $5 milliion to $8 million 
annually. If the Legislature also chooses to tax slot machine revenues, state tax revenues from Madison and Fromwit 
counties combined would range from $200 million to $500 million annually.

Ballot Measure 101: Open Primaries

Vote yes or no

Requires primary elections where voters may vote for any state or federal candidate regardless of party registration 
of voter or candidate. The two primary-election candidates receiving most votes for an ofﬁ ce, whether they are 
candidates with no party or members of same or different party, would be listed on general election ballot. Exempts 
presidential nominations. Fiscal Impact: No signiﬁ cant net ﬁ scal effect on state and local governments.

One-color version speciﬁ cations

If circumstances dictate that ballots be printed in only 
one color, certain adjustments should be made to the 
speciﬁ cations. 

Instruction title
Rather than process cyan, this title should be 
100% black.

Instructional ﬁ lls
For all background ﬁ lls, change from process cyan to 
10% black. This includes the ﬁ lls used with all ballot 
instructions, question instructions, and all navigational 
instructions. 

Attention icons
Rather than process cyan, all Attention icons should 
be 100% black. This includes icons for critical ballot 
instructions, as well as special question instructions.

Question titles
To create appropriate contrast with question 
instructions, question title ﬁ lls should be 20% black, 
rather than the 15% black used on two-color ballots.

Discussion

Translators ensure proper grammatical, syntactic, 
and structural character of the content and 
appropriate use of local dialect variations. Obviously, 
accurate translations are vital for non-English-
speaking voters. Online translations are often 
misleading, unclear, or simply wrong. The EAC can 
provide some model translations.

A cultural expert can review translated material 
to ensure that the translations are accurate and 
culturally relevant, and that their visual presentation is 
appropriate. 

Depending on State or local law, transliteration 
of candidate names into the appropriate Asian 
characters may or may not be required. When 
transliterating names, consultation with a language 
expert is recommended. Care should be taken to use

overall there are neither overtly positive nor overtly

When single-language ballots are produced with 
Asian languages, the following areas need additional 
consideration: 

Typeface choices
Non-Western typefaces should be selected on the 
basis of simplicity, compatibility with the Univers type 
family, and cultural appropriateness. In the application 
shown, LeHei Pro is used for Chinese.

Instructional illustrations
Make sure that instructional illustrations accurately 
reﬂ ect the language being used on the speciﬁ c ballot. 

Candidate names
All ballot text should be translated, and candidate and 
political party names transliterated.

Language indication
Though all poll workers are assumed to speak 
English, not all will be able to identify the language 
on a non-English ballot. Non-English ballots should 
include this block to identify the language. The block 
should be placed near the bottom right-hand corner 
of the ballot, as far from ballot content as possible.

Fill: 10% process cyan, extends full width of 
one column, 0.1” above topmost ascender, and 0.1” 
below lowest baseline of type.

Type: Univers 45 Light, size 12 pt., leading 13 pt., 
tracking -20, 100% black, center aligned, centered 
between top and bottom of ﬁ ll.

Design: two languages

On pages 3.35–3.49, design best practices for a general election two-language 
ballot are illustrated. Production speciﬁ cations and discussion notes are 
provided—including typeface,* type size, leading, line weights, tint ﬁ lls, and 
distances between elements. 

The ballot content used in these samples was originally developed by NIST to 
illustrate a “moderately complex” ballot. Although it is impossible to cover every 
ballot scenario, most general election ballot layout issues can be addressed using 
these designs.

Components 
As illustrated on the following page, an optical scan ballot has four basic 
component content areas:

A  Election information (e.g., jurisdiction, general election, and date) 

B  Ballot instructions

C  Ballot navigation, including page numbers and reminders to vote on the other side 
      or go on to the next page

D  Questions, including contests, retentions, and ballot measures

Each of these components is illustrated at its full size, and production 
speciﬁ cations are included. Speciﬁ cations are numbered from  1  through  6 . 

Designers can apply speciﬁ cations in this section to other paper ballot formats, 
such as absentee, emergency, and primary election ballots.

*The EAC does not endorse any speciﬁ c product or vendor. The best practices illustrated 

throughout this document do not rely on speciﬁ c software, products, or vendors. For copyright 
reasons, the EAC cannot supply election ofﬁ cials with the fonts used in the InDesign ﬁ les. 
They are available from numerous suppliers.

Election information speciﬁ cations

Discussion

Though this is important content, it should not be set 
so large that it affects the amount of room left for 
instructions and ballot content actually used by the 
voter.

Information deﬁ ning the speciﬁ cs of the election 
should be placed above the left column of the face 
of every ballot page outside the area used by the 
voter and the scanner. Content should include the 
statement “Ofﬁ cial Ballot,” along with election type, 
location, and date. The second language should be to 
the right of the ﬁ rst, in line with the second column. 
Local laws may require that additional information be 
included.

Election information
On ballots with space constraints, election 
information may be set at a minimum size. For ballots 
with more available space, larger type is encouraged.

Minimum size type for all, Language One: Univers 65 
Bold, size 10 pt., leading 11 pt., tracking -20, 100% 
black, left aligned.

Minimum size type for all, Language Two: Univers 45 
Light, size 10 pt., leading 11 pt., tracking -20, 100% 
black, left aligned.

Maximum size type for title, Language One: Univers 
65 Bold, size 18 pt., leading 20 pt., tracking -20, 100% 
black, left aligned.

Maximum size type for title, Language Two: Univers 
45 Light, size 18 pt., leading 20 pt., tracking -20, 
100% black, left aligned.

Maximum size type for location and date, Language 
One: Univers 65 Bold, size 12 pt., leading 14 pt.,

leading 15 pt., tracking -20, 100% process cyan, left

Space between languages should be 0.1”.

Discussion

The decision to apply color only to instructions was 
conﬁ rmed by feedback from usability testing and 
literacy experts.

Illustrative diagrams that accurately reﬂ ect the ballot 
type and equipment further clarify instructions and 
processes.

Informational icons are used to draw attention to 
unique or important areas of the ballot or to improve 
the voter’s ability to scan dense information. 

Embedding ballot instructions in ballots supports 
greater voting focus and autonomy for users, as does 
the use of simple language, numbered steps, and 
clear, speciﬁ c illustrations. Ballot instructions, running 
either vertically or horizontally, must be self-contained 
and separated from contest data. Vertical instruction 
treatments cannot share column space with 
contests—test voters often overlooked races located 
immediately beneath vertical instructions. Horizontal 
instructions running atop vertically placed contests in 
columns require the voter to read across (instructions) 
and then down-up (contests), which adds a slight 
learning challenge compared to an all-vertical layout.

Ballot navigation speciﬁ cations

Discussion

These ballot navigation guides help move voters 
through the ballot, telling them where they are in the 
process and where to go next. 

Ballot pages should be numbered with large, bold 
numbers to aid in ballot completion. 

Informational icons such as arrows and exclamation 
points (next page) are offered to draw attention to 
unique or important areas of the ballot or to improve 
the voter’s ability to scan dense information.

These informational icons are available at
www.eac.gov. 

The decision to apply color only to instructions was 
conﬁ rmed by feedback from usability testing and 
literacy experts.

Depending on the printer, paper used, and other 
production variables, the percentages speciﬁ ed 
for ﬁ lls (e.g., 10% process cyan) may need to be 
adjusted. The vendor should provide a test sample 
for review.

Speciﬁ cations for each instruction element are 
referenced by number below.

1

Page numbering
Current and total page numbers should be placed in 
the top right corner of each face of every ballot page. 

Current page type: Univers 65 Bold, size 36 pt., 
tracking -20, 100% black.

Total page type: Univers 65 Bold, size 12 pt., tracking 
-20, 100% black.

2

Instruction ﬁ ll
Navigational instructions should be placed at the 
end of the ﬁ nal column on each ballot face, to tell the 
voter what to do next.

Fill: 10% process cyan, extends full width of the 
column, 0.1” above topmost ascender of type, and 
0.1” below lowest baseline of type.

Discussion

Informational icons such as exclamation points and 
arrows are offered to draw attention to unique or 
important areas of the ballot or to improve the voter’s 
ability to scan dense information.

These informational icons are available at
www.eac.gov. 

The use of political party icons is not encouraged, 
because literacy experts and design professionals 
believe they simply confuse many voters.

The decision to apply color only to instructions was 
conﬁ rmed by feedback from usability testing and

Depending on the printer, paper used, and other 
production variables, the percentages speciﬁ ed

Discussion

All candidates in any given contest should be 
given the same amount of vertical space. If one 
candidate’s name must break onto a second line, the 
vertical space for all candidates should be changed to

Candidate information
First name should begin no less than 0.1” below 
bottom of instructions ﬁ ll; on ballots with set 
selection locations, the distance may need to be 
greater. Subsequent names should begin 0.1” below 
separation line of previous candidate. Names should 
be set as close as possible to the selection location. 
On contests with a two-person ticket, the word 
“and” should be placed alone on a separate line 
between the two candidate names.

Name type: Univers 65 Bold, size 12 pt., leading 13 
pt., tracking -20, 100% black, left aligned.

Party type: Univers 45 Light, size 12 pt., leading 13 
pt., tracking -20, 100% black, left aligned.

Separation line
Each candidate option should be followed by a line 
to clearly deﬁ ne it, even if it is the ﬁ nal option in a 
particular contest. Line should be placed no less 
than 0.1” below the lowest baseline of candidate 
information; on ballots with set selection locations, 
the distance may need to be greater. Line should 
also be located 0.1” above topmost ascender of the 
following candidate name, if applicable.

Line: 0.25 pt. line, 100% black, extends full width of 
column area allowed for candidates. 

Write-in
Begins 0.1” below ﬁ nal line of previous candidate. 
Write-in line should be placed no less than 0.3” 
below lowest baseline of type; on ballots with set 
selection locations, the distance may need to be 
greater.

On contests with a two-person ticket, a second 
write-in line should be added. Line should be placed 
no less than 0.3” below the ﬁ rst. Spacing before both 
lines should be equal.

Type, Language One: Univers 65 Bold, size 12 pt., 
leading 13 pt., tracking -20, 100% black, left aligned.

Type, Language Two: Univers 45 Light, size 12 pt., 
leading 13 pt., tracking -20, 100% black, left aligned.

Use a forward slash to separate languages if both ﬁ t 
on a single line. If they are on separate lines, do not 
add additional space between languages.

Write-in line: 0.5 pt. line, dashed 4 pt./4 pt., 100% 
black, extends full width of column area allowed for 
candidates.

Separation line
Each selection option should be followed by a line 
to clearly deﬁ ne it, even if it is the ﬁ nal option in 
a particular question. Line should be placed 0.1” 
below lowest baseline of selection option; on ballots 
with set selection locations, the distance may need 
to be greater. Line should also be located 0.1” 
above topmost ascender of the following option, if 
applicable.

Line: 0.25 pt. line, 100% black, extends full width of 
column area allowed for selection options. 

Discussion

The decision to apply color only to instructions was 
conﬁ rmed by feedback from usability testing and 
literacy experts.

All names in any given retention question should 
be given the same amount of vertical space. If one 
candidate’s name must break onto a second line, the 
vertical space for all candidates should be changed to 
match.

Optical scan ballots

Samples: two languages 

Optical scan ballot design best practices are applied to two-language variations on 
pages 3.51–3.57. The variations include a one-color version and an Asian-language 
version. 

Speciﬁ cations that vary from those outlined previously are included. The samples 
illustrate the ﬂ exibility of the design best practices.

The sample Chinese text in this section has been professionally translated, but 
translations do not reﬂ ect a speciﬁ c elections expertise. The translated Spanish 
text has been edited to support election terminology recommended in the EAC’s 
“Glossary of Key Election Terminology, English-Spanish, 2007.”

Electronic ﬁles 
The electronic ﬁ les that were used to create these best practices are available at 
www.eac.gov.

They are provided in two formats: Acrobat (.pdf) and InDesign (.indd).*

Each item has a unique identiﬁ cation number and ﬁ le name. For example, 
the Acrobat ﬁ le of the illustration on the next page is “OpScan_2L_VersionA.pdf.”

How to work with the samples and electronic ﬁ les
The Acrobat ﬁ les can be printed on an ofﬁ ce printer (depending on paper size), or 
by a local vendor with digital printing capabilities (printing ﬁ rms and copy shops 
often have digital printing capabilities). Printed versions of these samples will serve 
as an important reference during the ballot design and production process.

InDesign ﬁ les are template ﬁ les that can be edited. The illustrative diagrams 
used in the InDesign ﬁ les are also available at www.eac.gov. These ﬁ les end with 
“.eps” and can also be edited. Access to Adobe InDesign page layout software 
and to software that can edit .eps ﬁ les (e.g., Adobe Illustrator) is necessary. 
Working with a designer who has access to—and expertise in—these software 
programs is recommended.

Alternatively, these items can be recreated in other page layout programs using 
the production speciﬁ cations provided on pages 3.6–3.21; the Acrobat .pdf ﬁ les 
as a visual guide; and, if appropriate, the illustration ﬁ les provided. Using nonlayout 
programs, such as those commonly used to write text-only documents, is not 
appropriate or recommended. 

*The EAC does not endorse any speciﬁ c product or vendor. The best practices illustrated 

throughout this document do not rely on speciﬁ c software, products, or vendors. For copyright 
reasons, the EAC cannot supply election ofﬁ cials with the fonts used in the InDesign ﬁ les. 
They are available from numerous suppliers.

Instruction head
Rather than process cyan, this header should be 
100% black.

Instructional ﬁ lls
Rather than screened process cyan, all instructional 
ﬁ lls should be 10% black. This includes the ﬁ lls used 
with all ballot instructions, question instructions, and 
all navigational instructions. 

Attention icons
Rather than process cyan, all Attention icons should 
be 100% black. This includes icons for critical ballot 
instructions, as well as special question instructions.

Question titles
To create appropriate contrast with question 
instructions, question header ﬁ lls should be 20% 
black, rather than the 15% black used on two-color 
ballots.

When dual-language ballots are produced for 
non-English languages, certain situations should be 
considered. 

Typeface choices
Non-Western typefaces should be selected on the 
basis of simplicity, compatibility with the Univers type 
family, and cultural appropriateness. In the application 
shown, LeHei Pro is used for Chinese.

Instructional illustrations
Make sure that instructional illustrations accurately 
reﬂ ect the language being used on the speciﬁ c ballot. 

Candidate names
All ballot text should be translated, and candidate and 
political party names transliterated.

Language indication
Although it is assumed that all poll workers will speak 
English, not all will be able to identify the language 
on a non-English ballot. Non-English ballots should 
include this block to identify the language. The block 
should be placed near the bottom right-hand corner 
of the ballot, as far from ballot content as possible.

Fill: 10% process cyan, extends full width of 
one column, 0.1” above topmost ascender, and 0.1” 
below lowest baseline of type.

Type, Language One: Univers 65 Bold, size 12 pt., 
leading 13 pt., tracking -20, 100% black, center 
aligned.

Type, Language Two: Univers 45 Light, size 12 pt., 
leading 13 pt., tracking -20, 100% black, center 
aligned.

Use a forward slash to separate languages if both ﬁ t 
on a single line. If they are on separate lines, do not 
add additional space between languages. Type is 
centered between top and bottom of ﬁ ll.

Translators ensure proper grammatical, syntactic, 
and structural character of the content and 
appropriate use of local dialect variations. Obviously, 
accurate translations are vital for non-English-
speaking voters. Online translations are often 
misleading, unclear, or simply wrong.

A cultural expert can review translated material 
to ensure that the translations are accurate and 
culturally relevant, and that their visual presentation is 
appropriate. 

Depending on State or local legislation, transliteration 
of candidate names into the appropriate Asian 
characters may or may not be required. When 
transliterating names, consultation with a language 
expert is recommended. Care should be taken to use 
the most standard characters, and make sure that 
overall there are neither overtly positive nor overtly 
negative meanings in the sound-based characters.

The sample shown on page 3.56 does not have 
candidate names transliterated into Chinese. The 
sample below shows the recommended structure of 
a contest on a two-language ballot containing both 
English and transliterated Asian candidate names.

Full-face DRE ballots

Full-face direct-recording electronic (DRE) 
ballots

This section has three parts: (1) planning process information; (2) one-language 
full-face DRE ballot design best practices; and (3) additional samples.

Planning 
The Planning section (pages 4.4–4.5) outlines how to incorporate resources 
into your ballot development and production process; in what areas those 
resources may be of assistance; and when those activities should occur. It also 
offers tips on possible challenges and opportunities. These suggestions apply 
to both one-language and two-language ballots.

Design 
Best practice samples are illustrated in full and by component. These samples and 
components are accompanied by production speciﬁcations and discussion notes. 

Samples 
Additional best practice samples, including a one-color version, appear on pages 
4.23–4.25. 

Electronic versions of these ﬁles are available at www.eac.gov, and speciﬁ c 
instructions on how to use the electronic ﬁ les are included on page 4.22. The 
electronic ﬁ les are available in two formats, one of which can be edited. 

Election ofﬁ cials are encouraged to partner with their vendors and production 
partners to review the voluntary design recommendations in this document as 
early as possible.

Voter audience
This section details interface solutions for voters able to interact with a full-face 
DRE touch screen input. Ballot instructions, labels, and navigation, written in 
simple language, support comprehension by voters at a third-grade reading level.

Full-face DRE speciﬁ cations are based on information design principles, optical 
scan primary research ﬁ ndings, and accessibility requirements cited in 2005 
Voluntary Voter System Guidelines (VVSG) section 3.2.

Areas of further study
System solutions for alternative input/output variations (combining tactile, audio, 
and visual toolsets).

4.3

Full-face DRE ballots

Suggestions for best practices
The general election voter information prototypes shown on the following pages 
are based on VVSG, Americans with Disabilities Act guidelines (ADA), research 
ﬁ ndings, and information design principles. 

 —

Emphasize voter needs over administrative and vendor requirements.

 —

Use simple language for all content. Studies show that clear and concise writing 
is beneﬁ cial to voters at all literacy levels. Rewriting instructions ballot instructions 
and voter information materials using simple language increases usability and, on 
the voter’s behalf, accuracy. 

 —

Use one language per ballot, which is recommended practice. To meet usability 
standards, display no more than two languages simultaneously.

 —

Use upper- and lowercase sans serif type, set left aligned at the sizes outlined in 
the speciﬁ cations, for readability. Avoid setting text in a centered alignment. Avoid 
setting text in all capital letters. Minimize the number of fonts used. 

 —

Use color functionally and consistently. Color can draw the reader’s attention 
and emphasize important information. The use of color cannot be the sole means 
of conveying information or making distinctions. Another noncolor mode must 
complement color use, such as contrast, icon, text style, etc. (see VVSG).

 —

When clarifying instructions and processes, use accurate diagrams to describe 
voting technology and equipment. 

 —

Use instructional icons only. Universally recognized icons such as arrows are 
acceptable and encouraged.

Research ﬁndings 
Detailed ﬁndings that support ballot design best practices can be found in section 
6 and section 7. 

4.4

Full-face DRE ballots

Planning process

The planning table on the following page outlines additional resources and steps that 
can be taken to ensure that ballot content and design best address voter needs.

These recommendations are based on the best practices in Cook County, Illinois, 
and the pilot test in Nebraska.

Planning goals
These additional resources can help ensure that:

 —

Content is easily understood by voters, including those with low vision 
and literacy issues.

 —

The visual organization and presentation of the content supports ease of use 
and conﬁ dence in the process.

 —

Any necessary translations are accurate and sensitive to cultural differences 
in language and expression.

Planning value by role/resource

S — imple-language expert ensures that instructions and other ballot content are 

written in the most effective manner to help all voters (not just low-literacy voters) 
understand and follow instructions, and feel conﬁdent that they have properly cast 
their ballots.

 —

Information designer
 organizes the ballot content—text, graphics, illustrations— 
in a manner that is clear, simple, and functional, and that supports and enhances 
the voter’s comprehension of the content and voting process. (Note: The design 
ﬁeld is very broad; it is important to work with a designer who has expertise in the 
organization and presentation of complex information.) 

 —

Usability expert 
works with the information designer to develop review, testing, 
and revision processes that improve the ballot’s overall effectiveness, accuracy, 
and usability.

 —

Translator
 ensures proper grammatical, syntactic, and structural character of the 
content, and appropriate use of local dialect variations. Accurate translations are 
vital for non-English speaking voters, and online translations are often misleading, 
unclear, or simply wrong (for Spanish translations, see EAC document “Glossary 
of Key Election Terminology, English-Spanish, 2007”).

 —

Cultural expert
accurate and culturally relevant, and that their visual presentation is appropriate. 

 reviews translated material to ensure that the translations are 

Simultaneously hire a designer and a usability 
professional who can offer additional feedback.

Partner with a policy advisor who can help guide 
design improvements through the necessary 
legislative processes.

Whenever possible, hire a local person who will 
be able to meet with ofﬁ cials and the extended 
production team (vendors, printers, etc.).

Provide the designer with poll worker training, as 
well as any feedback from voters or poll workers.

Provide the designer with a complete list of current
election documents and legal requirements.

Translator

Translate content for non-English-speaking voters.

Understand the translator’s requirements before 
the election: data formats, time line, etc.

Have a third-party expert review the translated 
materials after the initial draft. Legal advisors may 
need to review the materials after simple language 
and design have been incorporated.

Review translated content in each alternative 
language for cultural relevancy.

Translation services may not be aware of possible 
cultural sensitivities of translated material.

Design

On pages 4.7–4.21, design best practices for a general election one-language 
ballot are illustrated. Production speciﬁ cations and discussion notes are provided— 
including typeface,* type size, leading, line weights, tint ﬁ lls, and distances 
between elements. 

The ballot content used in these samples was originally developed by the National 
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to illustrate a “moderately complex” 
ballot. Although it is impossible to cover every ballot scenario, most general 
election ballot layout issues can be addressed using these designs.

Components 
As illustrated on the following page, a full-face DRE ballot has four basic 
component content areas:

A  Election information (e.g., jurisdiction, general election, and date) 

B  Ballot instructions

C  Ballot navigation, in this ballot type, refers to highlighting casting step

D  Questions, including contests, retentions, and ballot measures

Each of these components is illustrated at its full size, and production 
speciﬁ cations are included. Speciﬁ cations are numbered from  1  through  6 . 

Designers can apply speciﬁ cations in this section to other paper ballot formats, 
such as absentee, emergency, and primary election ballots.

*The EAC does not endorse any speciﬁ c product or vendor. The best practices illustrated 

throughout this document do not rely on speciﬁ c software, products, or vendors. For copyright 
reasons, the EAC cannot supply election ofﬁ cials with the fonts used in the InDesign ﬁ les. 
They are available from numerous suppliers.

Shall state taxes be increased $175 million annually through 
additional tobacco taxes imposed for health related purposes, and, 
in connection therewith, amending the State constitution to increase 
statewide taxes on the sale of cigarettes by wholesalers of three and 
two-tenths cents per cigarette and on the sale, use, consumption, 
handling, or distribution of other tobacco products by distributors at 
the rate of twenty percent of the manufacturer’s list price; increasing 
such tobacco taxes effective January 1, 2005; requiring annual 
appropriations of speciﬁ ed percentages of the additional tobacco 
tax revenues to expand eligibility for and increase enrollment in the 
children’s basic health plan, to fund comprehensive primary medical 
care through certain State qualiﬁ ed providers, tobacco education 
programs, and prevention, early detection, and treatment of cancer 
and cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, to compensate the state 
general fund, the old age pension fund, and local governments for 
tobacco tax losses resulting from reduced sales of cigarettes and 
tobacco products; specifying that the appropriations of additional 
tobacco tax revenues shall be in addition to and not substituted for 
appropriations for such programs on January 1, 2005; allowing the use 
of additional tobacco tax revenues for any health related purpose and 
to serve populations enrolled in the children’s basic health plan and 
the state medical assistance program as of January 1, 2005, upon a 
declaration of a state ﬁ scal emergency by two-thirds of the members 
of each house of the general assembly and the governor; prohibiting 
the repeal or reduction of existing taxes imposed on cigarettes and 
other tobacco products; excluding all additional tobacco tax revenues 
from ﬁ scal year spending for purposes of section 20 of Article X of 
the State constitution; and exempting appropriations of additional 
tobacco tax revenues from the statutory limitation on general fund 
appropriations growth or any other existing spending limitation?

Proposed Constitutional Amendment D:
Recovery of Damages Relating to Construction

Vote yes or no

Shall there be an amendment to the State constitution concerning

Shall there be an amendment to the State constitution allowing the 
State legislature to enact laws limiting the amount of damages for 
noneconomic loss that could be awarded for injury or death caused by 
a health care provider?

“Noneconomic loss” generally includes, but is not limited to, losses 
such as pain and suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, loss of 
capacity for enjoyment of life, loss of consortium, and other losses 
the claimant is entitled to recover as damages under general law. This 
amendment will not in any way affect the recovery of damages for 
ecomonic loss under State law. “Economic loss” generally includes, 
but is not limited to, monetary losses such as past and future medical 
expenses, loss of past and future earnings, loss of use of property, 
costs of repair or replacement, the economic value of domestic 
services, loss of employment or business opportunities. This 
amendment will not in any way affect the recovery of any additional 
damages known under State law as exemplary or punitive damages, 
which are damages allowed by law to punish a defendant and to deter 
persons from engaging in similar conduct in the future.

Proposed Constitutional Amendment K: 
Slot Machines in Madison/Fromwit Counties

Vote yes or no

Shall there be an amendment to the State constitution authorizing 
Madison and Fromwit Counties to hold referenda on whether to 
authorize slot machines in existing, licensed parimutuel facilities 
(thoroughbred and harness racing, greyhound racing, and jai alai) that 
have conducted live racing or games in that county during each of the 
last two calendar years before effective date of this amendment?

The Legislature may tax slot machine revenues, and any such taxes 
must supplement public education funding statewide. Requires 
implementing legislation. This amendment alone has no ﬁ scal impact 
on government. If slot machines are authorized in Madison or Fromwit 
counties, governmental costs associated with additional gambling will 
increase by an unknown amount and local sales tax-related revenues 
will be reduced by $5 milliion to $8 million annually. If the Legislature 
also chooses to tax slot machine revenues, state tax revenues from 
Madison and Fromwit counties combined would range from $200 
million to $500 million annually.

Ballot Measure 101: Open Primaries

Vote yes or no

Requires primary elections where voters may vote for any state or 
federal candidate regardless of party registration of voter or candidate. 
The two primary-election candidates receiving most votes for an 
ofﬁ ce, whether they are candidates with no party or members of same 
or different party, would be listed on general election ballot. Exempts 
presidential nominations. Fiscal Impact: No signiﬁ cant net ﬁ scal effect 
on state and local governments.

Allows individual or class action “unfair business” lawsuits only if actual 
loss suffered; only government ofﬁ cials may enforce these laws on 
public’s behalf. Fiscal Impact: Unknown state ﬁ scal impact depending 
on whether the measure increases or decreases court workload and 
the extent to which diverted funds are replaced. Unknown potential 
costs to local governments, depending on the extent to which diverted 
funds are replaced.

Ballot Measure 111: 
Revenue Bonds for Renovation of Madison County Jail Facilities

Vote yes or no

Directs the Madison County Public Safety Authority, a building

pursuant to Section 346.27 of the State Code, for the purpose of 
acquiring, destroying, demolishing, improving, enlarging, equipping, 
furnishing, repairing, maintaining and operating one or more public 
buildings for the joint use of the County, the City or any school district 
which is part of the County, to issue its revenue bonds in an amount 
not exceeding $29,700,000 for the purpose of acquiring, constructing, 
furnishing, equipping, renovating and expanding existing jail facilities for 
the joint use of the County and the City.

Ballot Measure 114: Financing for Mass Transit

Vote yes or no

Shall regional transportation district taxes be increased $158.34 million 
annually and by whatever additional amounts are raised annually 
thereafter by increasing the rate of sales tax levied by the district by 
four-tenths of one percent, from the current six-tenths of one percent 
to one percent commencing January 1, 2005 and, in connection 
therewith, shall regional transportation district debt be increased 
$3.477 billion, with a repayment cost of $7.129 billion with all proceeds 
of debt and taxes to be used and spent for the construction and 
operation of a ﬁ xed guide way mass transit system, the construction 
of additional park-n-ride lots, the expansion and improvement of 
existing park-n-ride lots, and increased bus service, including the use of 
smaller buses and vans and alternative fuel vehicles as appropriate, as 
speciﬁ ed in the transit expansion plan adopted by the board of directors 
of the district on or before April 22, 2004 and shall debt be evidenced 
by bonds, notes, or other multiple-ﬁ scal year obligations including 
refunding bonds that may be issued as a lower or higher rate of interest 
and including debt that may have a redemption prior to maturity with or 
without payment of a premium, payable from all revenues generated 
by said tax increase, federal funds, investment income, public and 
private contributions, and other revenues as the board may determine, 
and with such revenues raised by the sales tax rate increase and the 
proceeds of debt obligations and any investment income on such 
revenues and proceeds being exempt from the revenue and spending 
restrictions contained in section 20 of Article X of the State constitution 
until such time as all debt is repaid when the rate of tax will be 
decreased to that amount necessary for the continued operation of the 
system but not less than six-tenths of one percent?”

Discussion

A primary voter criticism of ballots is the length and 
complexity of ballot measures. It is imperative that 
these questions be written in the simplest language 
possible. Many jurisdictions also provide summaries. 

The typesetting of the ballot measure text is critical. 
Too many or too few characters per line inhibit 
legibility and comprehension. The goal should be 40–
60 characters per line. Research indicates that many 
users ﬁnd line lengths of more than 60 characters or 
less than 20 characters hard to read. 

There is a direct relationship between type size 
and line spacing (leading). Lines of type that are too 
close together or too far apart inhibit legibility and 
comprehension. Ballot measure content in these best 
practices is set at 14 points, with 3 points of leading.

The decision to apply color only to instructions is the 
result of feedback from optical scan ballot usability 
testing and literacy experts. 

Depending on the printer, paper used, and other 
production variables, the percentages speciﬁ ed 
for ﬁ lls (e.g., 10% process cyan) may need to be 
adjusted. The vendor should provide a test sample for 
review.

Full-face DRE ballots

Samples 

Full-face DRE ballot design best practices samples appear on pages 4.23–4.25. 
For the one-color version, speciﬁcations that vary from those outlined in the 
Design section are detailed opposite the example. 

The ballot content used in these samples was originally developed by the National 
Institute of Standards and Technology to illustrate a “moderately complex” ballot. 
Although it is impossible to cover every ballot scenario, most general election 
ballot layout issues can be addressed using this content. 

Electronic ﬁles 
The electronic ﬁ les that were used to create these best practices are available at 
www.eac.gov.

They are provided in two formats: Acrobat (.pdf) and InDesign (.indd).*

Each item has a unique identiﬁ cation number and ﬁ le name. For example, 
the Acrobat ﬁ le of the illustration on the next page is “FullFace_1L_VersionA.pdf.”

How to work with the samples and electronic ﬁ les
The Acrobat ﬁ les can be printed on an ofﬁ ce printer (depending on paper size), or 
by a local vendor with digital printing capabilities (printing ﬁ rms and copy shops 
often have digital printing capabilities). Printed versions of these samples will serve 
as an important reference during the ballot design and production process.

InDesign ﬁ les are template ﬁ les that can be edited. The illustrative diagrams used 
in the InDesign ﬁ les are also available at www.eac.gov. These ﬁ les end with 
“.eps” and can also be edited. Access to Adobe InDesign page layout software 
and to software that can edit .eps ﬁ les (e.g., Adobe Illustrator) is necessary. 
Working with a designer who has access to—and expertise in—these software 
programs is recommended.

Alternatively, these items can be recreated in other page layout programs using 
the production speciﬁ cations provided on pages 4.6–4.21; the Acrobat .pdf ﬁ les 
as a visual guide; and, if appropriate, the illustration ﬁ les provided. Using nonlayout 
programs, such as those commonly used to write text-only documents, is not 
appropriate or recommended. 

*The EAC does not endorse any speciﬁ c product or vendor. The best practices illustrated 

throughout this document do not rely on speciﬁ c software, products, or vendors. For copyright 
reasons, the EAC cannot supply election ofﬁ cials with the fonts used in the InDesign ﬁ les. 
They are available from numerous suppliers.

Shall state taxes be increased $175 million annually through 
additional tobacco taxes imposed for health related purposes, and, 
in connection therewith, amending the State constitution to increase 
statewide taxes on the sale of cigarettes by wholesalers of three and 
two-tenths cents per cigarette and on the sale, use, consumption, 
handling, or distribution of other tobacco products by distributors at 
the rate of twenty percent of the manufacturer’s list price; increasing 
such tobacco taxes effective January 1, 2005; requiring annual 
appropriations of speciﬁ ed percentages of the additional tobacco 
tax revenues to expand eligibility for and increase enrollment in the 
children’s basic health plan, to fund comprehensive primary medical 
care through certain State qualiﬁ ed providers, tobacco education 
programs, and prevention, early detection, and treatment of cancer 
and cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, to compensate the state 
general fund, the old age pension fund, and local governments for 
tobacco tax losses resulting from reduced sales of cigarettes and 
tobacco products; specifying that the appropriations of additional 
tobacco tax revenues shall be in addition to and not substituted for 
appropriations for such programs on January 1, 2005; allowing the use 
of additional tobacco tax revenues for any health related purpose and 
to serve populations enrolled in the children’s basic health plan and 
the state medical assistance program as of January 1, 2005, upon a 
declaration of a state ﬁ scal emergency by two-thirds of the members 
of each house of the general assembly and the governor; prohibiting 
the repeal or reduction of existing taxes imposed on cigarettes and 
other tobacco products; excluding all additional tobacco tax revenues 
from ﬁ scal year spending for purposes of section 20 of Article X of 
the State constitution; and exempting appropriations of additional 
tobacco tax revenues from the statutory limitation on general fund 
appropriations growth or any other existing spending limitation?

Proposed Constitutional Amendment D:
Recovery of Damages Relating to Construction

Vote yes or no

Shall there be an amendment to the State constitution concerning 
recovery of damages relating to construction of real property 
improvements, and, in connection therewith, prohibiting laws that 
limit or impair a property owner’s right to recover damages caused 
by a failure to construct an improvement in a good and workmanlike 
manner; deﬁ ning “good and workmanlike manner” to include 
construction that is suitable for its intended purposes; and permitting 
exceptions for laws that limit punitive damages, afford governmental 
immunity, or impose time limits of speciﬁ ed minimum lengths on ﬁ ling 
lawsuits?

Yes

No

Yes

No

Shall there be an amendment to the State constitution allowing the 
State legislature to enact laws limiting the amount of damages for 
noneconomic loss that could be awarded for injury or death caused by 
a health care provider?

“Noneconomic loss” generally includes, but is not limited to, losses 
such as pain and suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, loss of 
capacity for enjoyment of life, loss of consortium, and other losses 
the claimant is entitled to recover as damages under general law. This 
amendment will not in any way affect the recovery of damages for 
ecomonic loss under State law. “Economic loss” generally includes, 
but is not limited to, monetary losses such as past and future medical 
expenses, loss of past and future earnings, loss of use of property, 
costs of repair or replacement, the economic value of domestic 
services, loss of employment or business opportunities. This 
amendment will not in any way affect the recovery of any additional 
damages known under State law as exemplary or punitive damages, 
which are damages allowed by law to punish a defendant and to deter 
persons from engaging in similar conduct in the future.

Yes

No

Yes

No

Yes

Proposed Constitutional Amendment K: 
Slot Machines in Madison/Fromwit Counties

Vote yes or no

Shall there be an amendment to the State constitution authorizing 
Madison and Fromwit Counties to hold referenda on whether to 
authorize slot machines in existing, licensed parimutuel facilities 
(thoroughbred and harness racing, greyhound racing, and jai alai) that 
have conducted live racing or games in that county during each of the 
last two calendar years before effective date of this amendment?

The Legislature may tax slot machine revenues, and any such taxes 
must supplement public education funding statewide. Requires 
implementing legislation. This amendment alone has no ﬁ scal impact 
on government. If slot machines are authorized in Madison or Fromwit 
counties, governmental costs associated with additional gambling will 
increase by an unknown amount and local sales tax-related revenues 
will be reduced by $5 milliion to $8 million annually. If the Legislature 
also chooses to tax slot machine revenues, state tax revenues from 
Madison and Fromwit counties combined would range from $200 
million to $500 million annually.

Ballot Measure 101: Open Primaries

Vote yes or no

Requires primary elections where voters may vote for any state or 
federal candidate regardless of party registration of voter or candidate. 
The two primary-election candidates receiving most votes for an 
ofﬁ ce, whether they are candidates with no party or members of same 
or different party, would be listed on general election ballot. Exempts 
presidential nominations. Fiscal Impact: No signiﬁ cant net ﬁ scal effect 
on state and local governments.

Allows individual or class action “unfair business” lawsuits only if actual 
loss suffered; only government ofﬁ cials may enforce these laws on 
public’s behalf. Fiscal Impact: Unknown state ﬁ scal impact depending 
on whether the measure increases or decreases court workload and 
the extent to which diverted funds are replaced. Unknown potential 
costs to local governments, depending on the extent to which diverted 
funds are replaced.

Ballot Measure 111: 
Revenue Bonds for Renovation of Madison County Jail Facilities

Vote yes or no

Directs the Madison County Public Safety Authority, a building 
authority incorporated by Madison County and the City of Ijamsville 
pursuant to Section 346.27 of the State Code, for the purpose of 
acquiring, destroying, demolishing, improving, enlarging, equipping, 
furnishing, repairing, maintaining and operating one or more public 
buildings for the joint use of the County, the City or any school district 
which is part of the County, to issue its revenue bonds in an amount 
not exceeding $29,700,000 for the purpose of acquiring, constructing, 
furnishing, equipping, renovating and expanding existing jail facilities for 
the joint use of the County and the City.

Ballot Measure 114: Financing for Mass Transit

Vote yes or no

Shall regional transportation district taxes be increased $158.34 million 
annually and by whatever additional amounts are raised annually 
thereafter by increasing the rate of sales tax levied by the district by 
four-tenths of one percent, from the current six-tenths of one percent 
to one percent commencing January 1, 2005 and, in connection 
therewith, shall regional transportation district debt be increased 
$3.477 billion, with a repayment cost of $7.129 billion with all proceeds 
of debt and taxes to be used and spent for the construction and 
operation of a ﬁ xed guide way mass transit system, the construction 
of additional park-n-ride lots, the expansion and improvement of 
existing park-n-ride lots, and increased bus service, including the use of 
smaller buses and vans and alternative fuel vehicles as appropriate, as 
speciﬁ ed in the transit expansion plan adopted by the board of directors 
of the district on or before April 22, 2004 and shall debt be evidenced 
by bonds, notes, or other multiple-ﬁ scal year obligations including 
refunding bonds that may be issued as a lower or higher rate of interest 
and including debt that may have a redemption prior to maturity with or 
without payment of a premium, payable from all revenues generated 
by said tax increase, federal funds, investment income, public and 
private contributions, and other revenues as the board may determine, 
and with such revenues raised by the sales tax rate increase and the 
proceeds of debt obligations and any investment income on such 
revenues and proceeds being exempt from the revenue and spending 
restrictions contained in section 20 of Article X of the State constitution 
until such time as all debt is repaid when the rate of tax will be 
decreased to that amount necessary for the continued operation of the 
system but not less than six-tenths of one percent?”

Shall there be an amendment to the State constitution allowing the 
State legislature to enact laws limiting the amount of damages for 
noneconomic loss that could be awarded for injury or death caused by 
a health care provider?

“Noneconomic loss” generally includes, but is not limited to, losses 
such as pain and suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, loss of 
capacity for enjoyment of life, loss of consortium, and other losses 
the claimant is entitled to recover as damages under general law. This 
amendment will not in any way affect the recovery of damages for 
ecomonic loss under State law. “Economic loss” generally includes, 
but is not limited to, monetary losses such as past and future medical 
expenses, loss of past and future earnings, loss of use of property, 
costs of repair or replacement, the economic value of domestic 
services, loss of employment or business opportunities. This 
amendment will not in any way affect the recovery of any additional 
damages known under State law as exemplary or punitive damages, 
which are damages allowed by law to punish a defendant and to deter 
persons from engaging in similar conduct in the future.

Proposed Constitutional Amendment K: 
Slot Machines in Madison/Fromwit Counties

Vote yes or no

Shall there be an amendment to the State constitution authorizing 
Madison and Fromwit Counties to hold referenda on whether to 
authorize slot machines in existing, licensed parimutuel facilities 
(thoroughbred and harness racing, greyhound racing, and jai alai) that 
have conducted live racing or games in that county during each of the 
last two calendar years before effective date of this amendment?

The Legislature may tax slot machine revenues, and any such taxes 
must supplement public education funding statewide. Requires 
implementing legislation. This amendment alone has no ﬁ scal impact 
on government. If slot machines are authorized in Madison or Fromwit 
counties, governmental costs associated with additional gambling will 
increase by an unknown amount and local sales tax-related revenues 
will be reduced by $5 milliion to $8 million annually. If the Legislature 
also chooses to tax slot machine revenues, state tax revenues from 
Madison and Fromwit counties combined would range from $200 
million to $500 million annually.

Ballot Measure 101: Open Primaries

Vote yes or no

Requires primary elections where voters may vote for any state or 
federal candidate regardless of party registration of voter or candidate. 
The two primary-election candidates receiving most votes for an 
ofﬁ ce, whether they are candidates with no party or members of same 
or different party, would be listed on general election ballot. Exempts 
presidential nominations. Fiscal Impact: No signiﬁ cant net ﬁ scal effect 
on state and local governments.

Allows individual or class action “unfair business” lawsuits only if actual 
loss suffered; only government ofﬁ cials may enforce these laws on 
public’s behalf. Fiscal Impact: Unknown state ﬁ scal impact depending 
on whether the measure increases or decreases court workload and 
the extent to which diverted funds are replaced. Unknown potential 
costs to local governments, depending on the extent to which diverted 
funds are replaced.”

Ballot Measure 111: 
Revenue Bonds for Renovation of Madison County Jail Facilities

Vote yes or no

Directs the Madison County Public Safety Authority, a building 
authority incorporated by Madison County and the City of Ijamsville 
pursuant to Section 346.27 of the State Code, for the purpose of 
acquiring, destroying, demolishing, improving, enlarging, equipping, 
furnishing, repairing, maintaining and operating one or more public 
buildings for the joint use of the County, the City or any school district 
which is part of the County, to issue its revenue bonds in an amount 
not exceeding $29,700,000 for the purpose of acquiring, constructing, 
furnishing, equipping, renovating and expanding existing jail facilities for 
the joint use of the County and the City.

Ballot Measure 114: Financing for Mass Transit

Vote yes or no

Shall regional transportation district taxes be increased $158.34 million 
annually and by whatever additional amounts are raised annually 
thereafter by increasing the rate of sales tax levied by the district by 
four-tenths of one percent, from the current six-tenths of one percent 
to one percent commencing January 1, 2005 and, in connection 
therewith, shall regional transportation district debt be increased 
$3.477 billion, with a repayment cost of $7.129 billion with all proceeds 
of debt and taxes to be used and spent for the construction and 
operation of a ﬁ xed guide way mass transit system, the construction 
of additional park-n-ride lots, the expansion and improvement of 
existing park-n-ride lots, and increased bus service, including the use of 
smaller buses and vans and alternative fuel vehicles as appropriate, as 
speciﬁ ed in the transit expansion plan adopted by the board of directors 
of the district on or before April 22, 2004 and shall debt be evidenced 
by bonds, notes, or other multiple-ﬁ scal year obligations including 
refunding bonds that may be issued as a lower or higher rate of interest 
and including debt that may have a redemption prior to maturity with or 
without payment of a premium, payable from all revenues generated 
by said tax increase, federal funds, investment income, public and 
private contributions, and other revenues as the board may determine, 
and with such revenues raised by the sales tax rate increase and the 
proceeds of debt obligations and any investment income on such 
revenues and proceeds being exempt from the revenue and spending 
restrictions contained in section 20 of Article X of the State constitution 
until such time as all debt is repaid when the rate of tax will be 
decreased to that amount necessary for the continued operation of the 
system but not less than six-tenths of one percent?”

Rolling DRE ballots

Rolling direct-recording electronic (DRE) 
ballot interface

This section has three parts: (1) planning process information; (2) an overview of the 
basic rolling DRE voting process, and (3) illustrations of core screen templates.

Planning 
The planning section on pages 5.4 and 5.5 outlines how to incorporate resources 
into your ballot development and production process; areas in which those 
resources may be of assistance; and when those activities should occur. It offers 
tips on possible challenges and opportunities. 

Voting process
This section describes the basic linear voting experience offered by our rolling 
DRE ballot. Core user activities in all DRE systems include voting, reviewing votes, 
casting votes, getting help, and adjusting screen settings.

Design templates
Essential screen templates, designed in support of primary values for the DRE 
voting process (page 5.6) are outlined on pages 5.32–5.37. 

Voter audience
This section details interface solutions for voters able to interact with a standard 
rolling DRE touchscreen input. Solutions use text sizes stipulated in 2005 Voluntary 
Voter System Guidelines (VVSG). Ballot instructions, labels, and navigation are 
written in simple language to support comprehension by voters at a third-grade 
reading level.

Rolling DRE speciﬁ cations are based on information design principles, primary 
research ﬁ ndings, and accessibility requirements cited in VVSG section 3.2.

Investigation into the design of hardware leading to fully accessible voting solutions 
is strongly encouraged but was not a part of this effort—the contractor did not work 
with vendors on this particular aspect. 

Final materials have been informed by an iterative research process involving 
reviews of existing products and practices, usability evaluations with representative 
voters, and interviews with elections professionals, subject matter experts, and 
poll workers. Without collaboration with vendors, design recommendations do not 
address the critical relationship between interaction design and hardware that many 
people with disabilities rely upon to vote. The best practices in this section focus 
exclusively on screen interactions.

Areas of further study
System solutions for alternative input/output variations (combining tactile, audio, 
and visual toolsets) and accessible prototypes for a Voter-Veriﬁ ed Paper Audit Trail 
(VVPAT) are recommended.

5.3

Rolling DRE ballots

Suggestions for best practices
The general election rolling DRE ballot prototypes shown on the following pages 
are based on VVSG, Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) guidelines, research 
ﬁ ndings, and information design principles. 

 —

Emphasize voter needs over administrative and vendor requirements. Ensure that 
default screen settings (type size, color use, contrast levels) are usable for the 
broadest range of voters as is reasonably possible.

 —

Process should be clear. Voters should always know where they are in the 
process. At the contest level, voters should know how to vote in a particular 
contest or question and know how many votes they have remaining in multi-
selection contests.

 —

Ensure that screen settings for language choices, text size, contrast, and audio 
support are readily available and easy to change.

 —

Use simple language for all content. Studies show that clear and concise writing 
is beneﬁ cial to voters of all literacy levels. Rewriting ballot instructions and voter 
information materials using simple language increases usability and, on the voter’s 
behalf, accuracy. 

 —

Use color functionally to emphasize important information, highlight processes, 
and support usability needs. However, the use of color cannot be the sole means 
of conveying information or making distinctions. Some other noncolor mode such 
as contrast, icon, text style, etc., must complement the color. This is a mandatory 
VVSG requirement to address color blindness.

 —

Ensure that voters can review their voting record and change their votes from any 
point in the ballot.

 —

Ensure that voters can easily compare their on-screen voting record with their 
printed record. Provide redundant conﬁrmations before a ballot is cast.

 —

Use upper- and lowercase sans serif type, set at a minimum of 25 points, for all 
ballot content voters will read. Given a choice between adequate type size and 
reducing the need to scroll lengthy referenda text, ballots with larger type were 
found to be more usable, even if voters needed to scroll. Avoid setting text in a 
centered alignment. Avoid setting text in all capital letters. Minimize the number of 
fonts used.

 —

Consideration should be given to candidate name order being rotated from 
precinct to precinct, so that all candidates will be listed ﬁ rst in roughly an equal 
number of precincts. 

 —

Use instructional icons only. Universally recognized icons such as arrows are 
acceptable and encouraged.

Research ﬁ ndings
Detailed ﬁ ndings that support the DRE ballot design best practices are in section 7.

5.4

Rolling DRE ballots

Planning process

The planning table on the following page outlines additional resources and steps that 
can be taken to ensure that ballot content and design best address voter needs.

These recommendations are based on the best practices in Cook County, Illinois, 
and the pilot test preparations in Nebraska.

Planning goals
These additional resources can help ensure that:

 —

Content is easily understood by voters, including those with low vision 
and literacy issues.

 —

The visual organization of the content supports ease of use and conﬁ dence in the 
process.

 —

Any necessary translations are accurate and sensitive to cultural differences 
in language and expression.

Planning value by role/resource

S — imple-language expert ensures that instructions and other ballot content are 

written in the most effective manner to help all voters (not just low-literacy voters) 
understand and follow instructions, and feel conﬁ dent that they have properly cast 
their ballots.

organization and presentation of complex information.) 

 —

Usability expert

content, and appropriate use of local dialect variations. Accurate translations are 
vital for non-English-speaking voters, and online translations are often misleading, 
unclear, or simply wrong (for Spanish translations, see EAC document “Glossary 
of Key Election Terminology, English-Spanish, 2007”).

Simultaneously hire a designer and a usability 
professional who can offer additional feedback.

Partner with a policy advisor who can help guide 
design improvements through the necessary 
legislative processes.

Whenever possible, hire a local person who will 
be able to meet with ofﬁ cials and the extended 
production team (vendors, printers, etc.).

Provide the designer with poll worker training, as 
well as any feedback from voters or poll workers.

Provide the designer with a complete list of current
election documents and legal requirements.

5.6 Rolling DRE ballots

Voting process

The rolling DRE interface design in this section supports intentional ballot 
completion by voters. Content, design, functionality, and navigation elements have 
each been developed to support this primary goal.

The interface design is based on VVSG statements on accessible type sizes for 
electronic displays. This default type size minimizes the screen setting steps 
required of low vision and it eliminates the need for many to adjust type size at 
all. This accessible type size allows language selection to be the ﬁ rst screen the 
voter sees. A voter can then receive all ballot content in their preferred language—
without resorting to the “help” section or requesting help from a poll worker.

Depending on screen resolution and screen orientation, more candidates may 
be displayed than are shown in the examples. If there are more candidates than 
will ﬁ t on one screen, an alternative would be to reduce button size based on the 
following criteria:

VVSG minimum button height is 0.5 inches and the minimum distance between 
buttons is 0.1 inches. Using the accessible type size illustrated here, buttons could 
be reduced to .62 inches in height (the accessible type size will not comfortably ﬁ t 
in a button only 0.5 inches in height) and the distance between buttons could be 
decreased to 0.1 inches to allow more names to appear on the screen at one time.

Key features of the voter’s experience are as follows:
Clear, simple instructions
Completion indicators 
Persistent review/edit access prior to casting vote
Undervoting notiﬁ cations
Easy to access help, instructions, and screen settings

Accessing help

From any screen the voter can access the Help main 
screen by touching the “Help” button  1 .

Main help screen
This screen serves as a hub, with four choices: 
the “Using the ballot”  2 , “Submitting candidates 
not on the ballot”  3 , and “Reviewing and casting 
your votes”  4  buttons all take the voter to detailed 
instructions on those topics. The fourth button, 
“Change screen settings”  5 , leads to another hub, 
where voters can adjust language, text size, screen 
contrast, and color and turn on audio.

The background color for all Help screens changes 
to a darker gray to alert voters that they have left the 
ballot area.

Instruction screens provide detailed text instructions 
combined with an animation loop that highlights key 
features and processes.

Nebraska pilot test overview

Preparing for an election can be a challenging, complicated process for election 
ofﬁ cials. Production cycles are organized around state-mandated deadlines that 
often leave narrow windows for successful content development, certiﬁ cation, 
translations, and election design activities. By keeping election schedules tightly 
controlled and making uniform voting technology decisions for local jurisdictions, 
States aspire to error-free elections. Unfortunately, current practices rarely include 
time or consideration for user-centered design development to address the basic 
usability needs of voters.

As a part of this research effort, a pilot study was conducted using professionally 
designed voter information materials and optical scan ballots in two Nebraska 
counties on Election Day, November 7, 2006. A research contractor partnered with 
Nebraska’s Secretary of State’s Ofﬁ ce and their vendor, Elections Systems and 
Software (ES&S), to prepare redesigned materials for Colfax County and Cedar 
County (Lancaster County, originally included, opted out of participation). The goal 
was to gauge overall design success with voters and collaborate with experienced 
professionals within an actual production cycle with all its variables, time lines, and 
participants.

This case study reports the results of voter feedback on election materials, 
observations, and interviews from Election Day, and insights from a three-way 
attempt to utilize best practice design conventions. Data gathered in this study 
informs the ﬁ nal optical scan ballot and voter information speciﬁ cations in sections 
2 and 3 of the best practices documentation.

Pilot study goals
Pilot test goals were identiﬁ ed within the following three categories:

Gain empirical knowledge of an elections production process 

 —

Understand production relationships between Nebraska ofﬁ cials and ES&S. 

 —

Understand legislated requirements and time lines in Nebraska affecting election 
design. 

 —

Understand how to successfully implement the professionally designed optical 
scan ballot and voter information guidelines. 

 —

Review historic election materials and processes.

Study the effectiveness of implemented guidelines on Election Day  

 —

Observe the success of designed materials in multiple polling environments. 

 —

Discuss materials with poll workers, voters, and ofﬁ cials for qualitative feedback.  

Analyze results and feedback  

 —

Compare current and historic election results to gauge design inﬂ uence on voting 
success. 

 —

Compare ﬁ nal Colfax County and Cedar County ballots. 

 —

Compare ﬁ nal ballot designs against proposed design conventions. 

 —

Analyze success of voter information materials. 

 —

Analyze observation data.

Nebraska pilot test

Production timeline

The table below provides an overview of research, design, and production 
activities in partnership with election ofﬁ cials and Nebraska’s ballot vendor, ES&S, 
leading up to the 2006 general election. All tasks supported State-regulated 
deadlines (shown in gray) as well as production requirements and deadlines 
communicated to ofﬁ cials by ES&S.

Date

Activity/deadline

Notes

August 1–31

Colfax and Cedar counties identiﬁ ed for pilot study participation 
by the secretary of state’s ofﬁ ce.

Lancaster County was engaged early in the process 
but dropped out because a key staff member left at the 
beginning of the process. The county decided that a new 
ballot production process and new staff would pose too 
many variables to serve voters efﬁ ciently and with adequate 
assurance of success.

County clerks showed a clear understanding that previous 
ballots had signiﬁ cant room for improvement, and 
enthusiastically accepted a wide range of ballot design 
changes.

August 1–31

Ballot design work based on counties’ draft election content 
begins.

Counties provided draft ballot content for initial layout.

August 1–31

Clerks in Cedar and Colfax counties approve ﬁ nal ballot designs, 
which are delivered to ES&S for initial production.

Ballot designs approved by county clerks were developed 
based on signiﬁ cant previous research and usability testing.

September 15

The secretary of state certiﬁ es ballot content.

September 15–22

ES&S and county ofﬁ cials provide onsite and phone support to 
incorporate design best practices into ﬁ nal ballots.

September 16

Secretary of state provides Spanish translations for Colfax 
County ballots.

September 22

Registered absentee voters are sent ballots for early voting.

October 1

ES&S completes ballot production.

Major hurdles included vendor’s proprietary ballot design 
software and ﬁ le formats. Also, the software was not 
developed to accommodate major design changes, so many 
recommended best practices were difﬁ cult or impossible to 
implement.

The ofﬁ cial Nebraska election calendar did not include 
requirements for translations necessary in Colfax county 
(currently the only county in the state required to offer a 
second language on the ballot).

Final ballots varied signiﬁ cantly from design best 
practices—including recommended fonts, leading, spacing 
between vote mark and candidate name, shaded ﬁ lls to 
differentiate voting instructions, and referendum layout. 

October 16–20

Field visits to polling locations in both counties.

Election ofﬁ cials interviewed, ballot preparations observed, 
poll locations analyzed for voter information strategy.

6.5

Nebraska pilot test

Production timeline

6.6

Nebraska pilot test

Findings

Production process relationships

 —

Local ofﬁ cials had modest control over service, costs, and quality in their State-
sponsored vendor contracts.

 —

 —

 —

 —

 —

Counties competed with one another for vendor resources to accomplish 
identical goals under identical state election deadlines. During the ballot design 
and production phase, pilot test personnel temporarily shared this management 
responsibility with ofﬁ cials so that the proposed best practices could be 
implemented to their fullest extent.

The Nebraska secretary of state’s ofﬁ ce had strong working relationships with 
pilot test personnel, ES&S, and the Cedar and Colfax county clerks. As an 
executive sponsor, the deputy of elections raised the visibility and credibility of the 
project and facilitated decision making. Pilot test personnel offered weekly, and 
sometimes daily, guidance and feedback to ES&S on local ballot layout, as well as 
suggestions for quality services (e.g., translations) that would advance the ballot 
design used in the general election.

Legislative requirements

Nebraska’s legislative time line allows only 2 weeks for ballot design and 
production between content certiﬁ cation and absentee voting deadlines for all 
ballot variations (splits) in each jurisdiction.

Nebraska law mandates the use of italicized text in referendums, which 
undermines ballot legibility as well as the core typographic value of italics (which 
should be used on a limited basis for emphasis).

Language used to describe statewide issues in the ballots is simpliﬁed from the 
“ofﬁ cial” descriptions offered in newspapers and on record, but it still poses a 
challenge for many voters. 

Implementing best practices

 —

ES&S and ofﬁ cials were enthusiastic about incorporating best practices but did not 
prioritize their execution.

 —

Colfax County’s bilingual ballot layout deviated from recommended best practices, 
which called for a vertical layout with English in one column and Spanish side-by-
side in the next column. Instead, the Colfax County ballot displayed an English 
paragraph followed by the translated Spanish paragraph, which made it difﬁ cult to 
read in either language.

 —

Cedar County’s ballot colors did not conform to design best practices when 
produced on an ES&S laser printer.

Ballot comparison

 —

For a complete comparison among the previous, proposed, and implemented 
ballots in Cedar and Colfax counties, see pages 6.8–6.14.

6.7

Nebraska pilot test

Findings

Election day observations

 —

Voters did not notice a signiﬁ cant difference between pilot study ballots and those 
used in the past in their jurisdictions. 

 —

Voters had few problems with ballots, and the chief complaint was ballot measure 
language.

 —

Poll workers in Colfax County supported a new, coherent voter information 
system.

 —

On Election Day, placement of voter information posters was limited to available 
wall space in polling places. This often reduced voters’ ability to see and use the 
information.

 —

Few voters noticed the voter information materials, and few poll workers directed 
voters to them. Poll workers generally answered voters’ questions themselves.

 —

When voters were directed to the information materials, voters and poll workers 
agreed on their value.

 —

Some voters were reluctant to request help from poll workers. Some asked other 
(sometimes active) voters for assistance instead.

 —

For voter information materials to be effective, they must be placed where voters 
will see them and can read them.

 —

Poster formats alone do not meet the needs of all polling precincts. In-booth and 
tabletop versions of the materials may be necessary.

Findings

Ballot comparison 

Various elements were redesigned for the Cedar 
and Colfax county ballots. The goal of the redesign 
was to improve clarity, legibility, and ease of use 
for the voter. Some of these elements were not 
fully implemented on the actual ballots used for the 
election.

Election information
Larger type is used for all information critical to the 
voter.

Page numbers
Page numbers are included to help the voter navigate 
multiple-page ballots. 

Voting instructions
Voting instructions have been greatly expanded; 
the language has been simpliﬁ ed, and they include 
illustrations.

Divisions by “ticket”
Previous ballots included subheads that divided the 
ballot into various categories. These subheads were 
removed, as they were inconsistent and redundant, 
and took emphasis away from the information of 
primary importance to the voter: candidate name and 
contest title.

Question titles
On the new ballots, a gray ﬁ ll helps voters scan 
questions more easily. This visual distinction clariﬁes 
where each new question begins. 

Question instructions
Instructions for each question are set apart from the 
title of the question and separated from the voting 
options area. 

Separation of candidates
Hairlines are used to clearly separate the candidate 
names and help voters make sure they are voting for 
their chosen option. 

Write-in voting
The write-in area has been clariﬁed through the use 
of a more intuitive dashed line and the explicit “or 
write-in:” identiﬁer. 

Ballot navigation
The new ballots use a clearer system of navigation 
to ensure that voters know where they are in the 
process and what remains to complete. Graphic 
symbols, such as arrows, provide visual emphasis 
and help low-literacy and low-vision voters.

Findings

State metrics/reporting
Statistics were derived from 2006 election summary reports provided by county 
clerks. Reports were electronically generated by ES&S counting equipment with 
a report title “Grand Totals Node 1 Format.” The Cedar County report was dated 
November 7, 2006, at 22:40:27. The Colfax County report was dated November 8, 
2006, at 06:22:36. 

Results from ballot questions to assess the best practices’ impact were analyzed. 
Undervoting and overvoting rates were calculated for each race by dividing 
registered voters by the total number of votes counted.

No strong pattern emerged to suggest that the order or placement of contests 
(whether on page 1 or page 2) made a signiﬁ cant difference to voters in deciding 
to vote in a race.

The governor/lieutenant governor overvote rate increased signiﬁ cantly in both 
counties—both in terms of previous elections in those counties and in comparison 
with other Nebraska counties. In Cedar County, the overvote rose from an average 
0.22% to 4.7% for the governor/lieutenant governor race. A sampling of 43 other 
Nebraska counties showed a 0.55% average overvote rate in this race. 

There is not enough information to determine what may have caused this 
anomaly. One possibility is that—unlike the prototype ballot designs using the 
NIST content—the governor’s race was the only paired-ticket contest on the ballot. 
Further study is necessary to determine what led to the overvote increase to 
identify its cause and try to prevent similar results in the future.

Recommendations

The 2006 pilot study in Nebraska demonstrated that the proposed design system 
was largely acceptable to participating voters and election ofﬁ cials, and could be 
partially implemented with moderate effort on the part of the participating service 
provider, ES&S. 

The study uncovered areas where adoption of the best practices will prove 
challenging, including legislative requirements, tight election calendars, limitations 
of ballot layout software, lack of experience with translation processes, lack of 
adequate ﬁnancial resources to fund signiﬁ cant improvements at the county level, 
and limited availability of skilled resources during peak election production times. 
These issues led to the following recommendations:

1. Conduct more observations and interviews. 
Future activity in this area should include conducting additional ﬁeld interviews 
with election ofﬁ cials from all levels of government, in all parts of the country, and 
in all roles in the ballot development process. A corollary recommendation is to 
continue dialog with manufacturers and service vendors. 

2. Explore voting experience options related to ballot design with industrial design 
experts and manufacturers. 
Graphic designers and usability experts can enhance the overall voting experience, 
but the critical relationship between the voter and the voting equipment should 
also be analyzed, particularly when addressing the needs of voters with disabilities 
(including mobility or vision). 

3. Extend optical scan ballot pilot tests to other locations. 
Research should include pilot tests in additional locations that will continue to 
challenge and reﬁne the proposed design systems. Selected locations should offer 
diversity in terms of geography, demographics, voting equipment, and legislative 
requirements. 

4. Initiate direct-recording electronic (DRE) ballot pilot studies. 
Future studies should include pilot tests with DRE voting equipment. The 
development of interactive prototypes for pilot-testing in a real election would be 
complex and would require considerable commitment, but the beneﬁt to voters 
would outweigh the investment. Pilot test locations should offer diversity in terms 
of geography, demographics, voting equipment, and legislative requirements. 

5. Collect most recent general election ballot samples and voting statistics. 
NIST’s small collection of ballots from 2004 elections was useful in developing the 
ballot design best practices. Establish a process to collect and make public a library 
of currently used ballots and correlated voting statistics. 

6. Analyze under- and overvoting by race/issue for the 2006 general election. 
Research should be conducted to understand the impact of design on individual 
race results by correlating rates of under- and overvoting to ballot design choices. 
While this would not be a fully scientiﬁ c study, the information would provide 
insight into the problems voters may have experienced without infringing on their 
privacy. 

6.17

Nebraska pilot test

Conclusion

7. Establish a national voter survey to measure ballot usability. 
Measure voter satisfaction with ballots using interviews and surveys, and analyze 
the results. The sample should include:

 —

Ten locations for each optical scan model, reﬂecting a geographically and 
demographically diverse population (model + geographical/demographic diversity 
x 10).

 —

Ten locations for each DRE model, reﬂecting a geographically and demographically 
diverse population.

8. Explore improvements to state and local legislation. 
Many State and local laws mandate speciﬁc design decisions. Study the extent to 
which Federal, State, and local laws regarding ballot design vary and how these 
laws may inhibit the creation of an effective national ballot design system. 

9. Establish a national ballot design system. 
Encourage a single, simple, and consistent national ballot design system, such 
as the system used for tax forms. This system should give voters control over 
candidate ordering on DRE ballots and provide a nationwide system for rotating 
candidate names on printed ballots. The system should include best practices for 
the use of simple language on ballot issues (referenda, measures, etc.).

Conclusion
The challenges for achieving a successful and satisfying voting experience 
extend well beyond ballot design. Ongoing study is necessary to identify existing 
and proposed legislative requirements that affect ballot design and the voting 
experience. Uniﬁed national ballot design best practices will form a baseline 
from which to measure national success in terms of the voter’s experience; help 
election ofﬁ cials work more efﬁ ciently; and allow manufacturers to focus on other 
issues of importance.

Nine research events

Overview

The design best practices in this document are the results of a user-centered 
process involving subject matter experts, election ofﬁ cials, and representative 
voters. Nine of the ten research events the contractor conducted between May 
and December 2006 are summarized in this section. Section 6 details the tenth 
event, a case study of pilot tests in Nebraska’s 2006 general election.

Report goals
This section presents a chronological account of research activities, 
communicates research ﬁ ndings, and provides the basis for making best practice 
recommendations.

Research goals
Goals were established to develop best practice recommendations at the outset of 
the user-centered design process. They included the following: 

 —

Expanding the body of knowledge and the library of best practices shared among 
election ofﬁ cials serving citizens.

 —

Increasing the likelihood that voting will be an easy, efﬁ cient, and accessible 
experience.

 —

 —

 —

Exploring the effectiveness, ﬂ exibility, and scalability of design best practices that 
have been identiﬁ ed and proposed for application in polling place voter information 
materials and in various ballot types, both optical scan and direct-recording 
electronic (DRE).

Understanding how election materials are used in typical environments and 
exploring the impact of environmental factors (e.g., location, lighting, temperature, 
trafﬁ c patterns, noise level) on the success of the prototypes.

Providing voters of various physical and language abilities the opportunity to 
directly participate in the development and evaluation of design best practices, 
increasing the likelihood that the needs of these audiences will be met effectively.

 —

Understanding legislative imperatives and operational challenges of the election 
design environment at the State and local levels. 

 —

Understanding the attitudes, behaviors, challenges, and needs of citizens who 
have a right to vote accurately, independently, and easily. Also, identifying models 
for common voter experiences.

 —

Understanding common practices in ballot and voter information design and 
development.

Research methodology
The contractor used the following research methods:

Assumptions
The researchers used the following assumptions in planning research and 
design activities:

 —

Audio design is product-speciﬁ c. Without engaging with a technology partner for 
rolling DRE development, audio solutions will not be included in best practices.

 —

Given the full-face ballot systems, expert input, and examples available to us, 
design best practices for paper-based full-face ballots can be extrapolated from 
the optical scan ﬁ ndings.

 —

Experts sufﬁ ciently represent audiences and issues for which they advocate, 
eliminating the need to test extensively with each represented population.

 —

Ethnographic and qualitative inquiry best support the identiﬁ cation of patterns, 
behaviors, and unspoken needs of voters and election ofﬁ cials. By studying what 
people do (observations and usability studies), rather than what they say (surveys 
and focus groups), the team can uncover not only how people generally react to 
materials but also why. To protect voters’ individual privacy, time and accuracy 
studies, though considered, were not pursued.

7.7

Nine research events

Recommendations

Language and content 
Emphasize voter needs over administrative and vendor requirements.

 —

Use clear, concise language (simple language) for all content.

 —

Use one language per ballot. To meet usability standards, display no more than 
two languages.

 —

Summarize long ballot measure text as another option (alongside required formats) 
to improve communication and usability for voters.

Text use and size 
Use upper- and lowercase sans serif type, set at a minimum of 12 points for all 
ballot content voters will read. Given the choice between adequate type size (12 
points) and fewer pages, ballots with 12 point type and more pages were found to 
be more usable than those with fewer pages and smaller type. Ballot legibility and 
ease of comprehension for voters are more important than printing costs.

 —

The Univers type family is a common, readable, and consistent font choice for 
all materials. 

 —

 —

 —

Non-Western typefaces should be selected on the basis of simplicity, compatibility 
with the Univers type family, and for cultural appropriateness. In the applications 
shown, LeHei Pro is used for Chinese.

The typesetting of the ballot measure text is critical. Too many or too few 
characters per line inhibit legibility and comprehension. The goal should be 40–60 
characters per line. Research indicates that many users ﬁ nd line lengths of more 
than 60 characters or less than 20 characters hard to read. 

There is a direct relationship between type size and line spacing (leading). 
Lines of type that are too close together or too far apart inhibit legibility and 
comprehension. Typical optical scan ballot measure content in these best practices 
is set at 12 points, with 2 points of line spacing.

Color 
Use a second color functionally and exclusively for instructions on optical 
scan ballots.

 —

On rolling DRE ballots, the strategic application of color effectively differentiates 
levels of information and voter activity.

Icons and graphics 
Accurate instructional illustrations help voters (especially less literate voters) 
understand requirements, processes, and options.

 —

! ,  ? , or  i  to draw attention to unique or 
Use informational icons such as 
important areas of the ballot or to improve the voter’s ability to scan dense 
information.

 —

Political party icons are not encouraged, as literacy experts and design 
professionals believe they simply confuse many voters.

Speciﬁ c recommendations by material

Voter information

Optical scan / full-face ballots

Rolling DRE ballots

Language
and content

Person-to-person communication is 
preferred by voters in polling places—
reading posted information is not their 
ﬁ rst impulse.

Bold/regular text use effectively 
differentiates languages derived from 
a common alphabet on two-language 
ballots.

Repetitive and consistent interactions 
are helpful to voters, particularly low-
literacy voters.

Limiting one contest per screen 
reduces incidents of undervoting.

Voters appreciate knowing ballot 
length and contents before voting.

Repetitive placement of information 
supports voter needs at various 
stages in the voting process.

Languages derived from different 
alphabets do not require bold/regular 
differentiation.

Long, required text (such as Bill of 
Rights data) is most easily accessed 
in table, booth, or binder formats, not 
in wall displays.

Long text (such as referendums) is 
most easily read in a two-column, 
side-by-side format.

Column labels on full-face ballots help 
orient voters and enhance readability.

Usable type size takes precedence 
over ballot length.

Text use and size

Titles should be shown at a size which  
is easily scanned and read by most 
voters at a distance of six feet when 
displayed on a wall.

Default setting should address the 
needs of the majority and provide 
additional settings, for those voters 
who need to adjust text size or 
increase contrast.

Color

Titles in white text against colored 
ADA-compliant backgrounds are 
easiest to read.

A second color tint effectively

User requirements

1 Prototypes reviewed by ofﬁ cials and experts were considered 

generally successful.

Feedback from ofﬁ cials and experts inﬂ uenced plans for 
formal usability tests and further research.

Further interviews should be conducted with accessibility 
experts to understand the pros and cons of each approach.

2 Election ofﬁ cials discussed pros and cons between natural/
electronic audio strategies in rolling DRE ballots. Some 
indicated a preference for digital audio, because this offers the 
ability to change speed and pitch while allowing users to skip 
sections of the ballot that don’t interest them. Advocates of 
natural voices noted that they are easier for many people to 
understand and are friendlier than digital solutions. This is an 
important consideration when many voters, not just those with 
hearing loss, can be intimidated by the voting process.

Next steps

 —

Collaborate with Alexia Morrison of Nebraska State Board of Elections to 
determine whether a pilot study during the November 2006 general election will 
be feasible.

 —

Plan usability tests of current prototypes with voters.

 —

Follow up with experts on voter accessibility requirements, particularly visual 
impairment issues.

ID Finding

Familiarity

1 Despite differences between the two counties observed, there was an informal, small-town atmosphere in all polling 

locations. Three factors contributed to this perception: 
1) Poll workers were “veterans” in their roles and at their locations; 
2) Turnout was low for the primary election and voters appeared to be dedicated, enthusiastic, and familiar with the local 
voting process; and 
3) Most voters were of the same age-group as poll workers and seemed to be acquainted with them outside the Election Day 
context.

Translations

2 Poll workers at Newark locations included English, Spanish, and Portuguese speakers, though only English and Spanish were 
required on the ballots. The English-speaking observation team noted few interactions taking place in non-English languages. 

Experience

3 Most of the poll workers the contractor interviewed had at least 4 years of experience but many had more than 10 years. Each 
poll worker tended to serve in the same polling location and shared casual conversation with voters while conducting election 
proceedings. 

The balance between helping voters, who were apparently social acquaintances in many cases, with new equipment while 
honoring their privacy appeared to pose a challenge to poll workers. 

Voter information summary

Topic

ID Finding

Conclusion

Logistics

1 The signs did not come with instructions. Poll workers claimed 

to “just know” how to hang signs based on available wall 
space, where the right location seemed “obvious,” or they just 
“knew where voters would look.” 

Signs should be labeled as indoor or outdoor and with a 
publication ID.

Poll workers and therefore voters may beneﬁ t from sample 
ﬂ oor plans explaining how and where posters based on 
ID should be displayed to enhance the ﬂ ow of trafﬁ c and 
improve the overall voter experience.

Best practices outlining optimal hanging height and 
sequence will also improve the readability and impact of 
voter information signs.

Plans should include a checklist of posters required so that 
those packing and receiving polling place kits can identify 
missing items before opening the polls.

Develop solutions for streamlining and organizing the 
transfer of voter information materials to polling locations.

2 In one Newark polling place, voter information posters were 
delivered mid-morning, hours after polls had opened. The 
purpose and placement of the voting information was unclear 
to poll workers, despite their experience. Twenty minutes after 
the voter information arrived, and with few voters present, poll 
workers continued to debate what to do with the new posters.

3 Polling place sign pick-up and delivery was inconsistent and 
not well organized. Large instructional posters for the DRE 
were packaged in the Sequoia AVC Advantage equipment and 
delivered to the polling place the night before Election Day. 
These materials were also returned for storage in the machines 
after the election. 

Along with provisional and emergency ballots and afﬁ davits, 
the elections judge picked up other signs the night before the 
election for hand delivery the morning of Election Day.

Placement

4 The physical environment at many polling places prevented 

optimal information ﬂ ow. Some locations were small and busy, 
with little room to post signs in such a way that they could 
help guide voters through a logical ﬂ ow of information. Other 
locations were large and posters got lost. 

Best practices should provide guidance regarding the size 
and number of posters to be displayed in various settings. 

Develop voter information packages appropriate for large 
and small locations and tailored to address the number of 
voters anticipated to participate.

Poster and
font size

Production

5 Voter information signs were typically 8.5” x 11” and appeared 
to be photocopied. There were two exceptions to this: the New 
Jersey Voter Bill of Rights was 11” x 17” and a “How to Vote” 
sign was 28” x 36”, mounted on foam core. 

The best practices recommendations should be sensitive 
to limited production skills, tools, ﬁ nances, and equipment 
available to election ofﬁ cials.

Quality of voter information materials should appropriately 
reﬂ ect the importance of the voting process.

6 Most posters were relatively generic, optimized for ease and 
speed of production rather than quality of user experience. 
Most likely, a basic design program was used to create the 
signs, which were then photocopied by the county. 

Directional signs, for example, arrows guiding voters through 
hallways to a voting location, were handmade in some 
locations.

Awareness

7 Few people paid attention to voter information. Voters who 
did approach signs stood quite close to them. This could 
indicate that voter information materials were poorly placed, 
unnecessary, or illegible.

Citizens should be able to identify the purpose of a voter 
information poster from a distance. Most people should be 
able to read details standing a comfortable distance from 
the wall, approximately 3 to 4 feet.

Instructions

8 Poll workers were somewhat unfamiliar with the new 

equipment used in New Jersey. 

Encourage poll workers to offer information to voters in 
multiple ways, reinforcing verbal instructions with simple 
and accurate written instructions when possible. 

Conﬁ rm that information on instructional posters matches 
ballot and equipment.

Consider providing hands-on, on-site demonstrations of 
voting technology to both voters and poll workers.

Poll workers in Newark referred to voter information posters 
when instructing voters. Unfortunately, “How to Vote” signs 
instructed voters to cast their ballot by pressing a yellow Cast 
Vote Button, however, the actual Cast Vote Button on the 
equipment was red. When poll workers told voters in the booth 
to press the yellow button, sometimes repeatedly, voters were 
unable to cast their ballots. 

Upon realizing the discrepancy, voters appeared less conﬁ dent 
in the system. 

Some poll workers and voters suggested that a model voting 
machine be used to demonstrate the process before entering 
the booth rather than relying solely on postings.

Information ﬂ ow

9 Despite effective voter information materials, poll workers play 
a primary role in assisting voters. This may be particularly true 
in primary elections (where trafﬁ c is reduced) compared with 
general elections, and in settings where voters and poll workers 
are familiar with one another.

Conclusion

Voter 
preparedness

1 New Jersey has historically required a full-face ballot, but the 
Sequoia AVC machine was introduced in Newark for the ﬁ rst 
time during this election. This gave the team the opportunity 
to observe new product introduction. The observers focused 
on voter interactions before and after their ballots were cast, 
paying special attention to questions directed to poll workers 
from behind the ballot booth curtains.

No speciﬁ c issues were observed with the ballot; however, 
many voters were relieved to ﬁ nd the layout of the new 
machine familiar. Some expressed frustration at having to 
learn a new system but didn’t mention speciﬁ c issues.

Methodology
Each participant voted using an optical scan ballot prototype and a proposed 
DRE ballot prototype. The order of the ballot types alternated at each session, 
and research moderators played the role of poll workers, answering questions or 
guiding participants only at their request.

To help the research team test primary use cases, participants were given a simple 
ballot script to vote for or against retentions, memorandums, and ballot measures. 

 —

Vote for a straight ticket (single party)

 —

Vote for a candidate in a winner-take-all contest

 —

Cast a write-in vote in a winner-take-all contest

 —

 —

Select a language (DRE)

After voting with both ballot types and viewing posted voter information, 
participants were asked to provide feedback on their ability to complete tasks and 
to discuss challenges and opportunities they encountered. 

The researchers probed design elements using visual aids such as ballot size, 
sequencing patterns, fonts, text size and alignment, contrast variations, language, 
instructional illustrations, navigational elements, white space, line weight, 
hierarchy, and color. The form and placement of voter selection marks was also 
reviewed.

Participants
The research team met with 44 English and bilingual English/Spanish speakers 
between the ages of 21 and 79 years. Participants were recruited through local 
election ofﬁ cials, online classiﬁ ed ads, and national recruiting ﬁ rms.

Conclusion

General

1 Voter information was well accepted. Participants and election 

ofﬁ cials offered few suggestions for improvement.

Multiple 
languages

2 Some participants requested that information be aggregated by 
language rather than by topic. For example, Chinese speakers 
would be able to read information in one place rather than 
across three signs.

As with ballots, the research team recommends single-
language presentation with accurate and context-speciﬁ c 
translations. 

Limit presentation to two languages per poster.

Color

3 The color system and clean design effectively directed attention 

and established voting as an important citizen’s duty.

4 The color system was considered easy to read and engaging.

Life expectancy/
durability

5 Election ofﬁ cials designated some postings as permanent and 
others as disposable and contest-based. Life expectancy helps

ID Finding

Conclusion

Multiple 
languages

1 Although most participants supported the idea of multiple 
language options on ballots, a majority preferred single-
language presentation because it allowed them to proceed 
more quickly and with greater clarity. 

Recommend single-language presentation with top-quality, 
accurate, contextual translations. 

Limit presentation to two languages per ballot on printed 
materials.

2 Security (particularly with optical scan ballots) and accuracy 
of translations was a concern, rather than usability, when 
discussing single-language presentation.

3 Some areas require more than one language to be presented 
on a ballot simultaneously. For example, Los Angeles County, 
CA, requires more than six languages on one ballot. 

Use of multiple languages on ballots poses signiﬁ cant 
usability issues.

Readability

Simple language should be used for all ballot content. 

4 The length and language used in measures in the prototype 
proved problematic for many users. For example, there was 
concern about making accurate selections when double 
negatives were used in descriptive copy.

Text for amendments and referendums should be kept as 
short as possible. 

Use short sentences and paragraphs with direct structure.

5 Ballot measure titles on the prototype used were not found to 

Use titles that accurately introduce ballot content.

be descriptive of content. 

Navigation

6 Participants wanted a reference to their place in the ballot 
to help them manage their time and feel in control of their 
progress. Since participants could not scan the full contents of 
the ballot as they can with paper systems, this was particularly 
important while participants worked with the DRE prototype.

Page numbers should be used with all ballots to help users 
maintain their sense of control over the experience.

Similar referencing should be applied to the DRE prototype; 
an overall table of contents should also be provided.

7.21

Events

Event three

Ballot summary (continued)

Color

7 Users appreciated the use of color, preferring it to black-and-

white versions.

Color can be an effective tool for differentiating information 
on ballots, but should be used to clarify rather than as mere 
decoration.

Accessibility

8 Some participants had difﬁ culty using optical scan ballots, 
expressing discomfort with readability and control over 
handwriting.

Users preferred the DRE prototype. Most felt that it was 
faster and easier to use than the optical scan prototype, 
although both featured the same content.

This could be related to the success in design rather than 
platform. 

Learnability

9 Some participants were unfamiliar with computers and initially 

felt intimidated by the DRE prototype. 

These participants quickly learned how to use the prototype 
and moved easily through the ballot.

First-time or infrequent voters will need simple how-to-vote 
instructions before voting. Optimally, this will occur before 
Election Day. Simple opt-in tutorials are also recommended 
for DRE solutions.

Security

10 Security concerns were often voiced when discussing 

electronic formats and rarely were brought up with paper 
ballots.

Visual design can signiﬁ cantly increase the perception 
of credibility, but back-end programming must support 
promises made in the user interface. 

Familiarity

Readability

11 Participants and election ofﬁ cials preferred familiar ballots and 
voter information materials, even when familiar materials were 
recognized as inferior.

The evolution of election design practices and materials 
should be gradual to accommodate user learning curves and 
comfort levels.

12 Referendums and measures were difﬁ cult to understand, as 
were instructions for straight-party voting. Simple language 
requirements should be implemented to create baselines for 
reading levels and paragraph lengths in ballots.

Use short sentences and paragraphs. 

Summarize lengthy information at the beginning of 
statements. 

Set minimum, measurable standards for writing such as 
California’s requirement that referendums have 75 words 
or fewer or a Flesh-Kincaid Grade Level score or a Flesh 
Reading Ease score.

Navigation

13 Participants quickly fell into interaction patterns regardless of 

content variations.

There should be a clear system and placement for all ballot 
components such as contest titles, candidate choices, 
instructions, navigation, etc.

Instructions

14 Participants often failed to notice that voting instructions 

changed from contest to contest.

Call out changes in voting instructions with graphic 
techniques such as a countdown system, color, or graphic 
symbols.

Best practices in election usability testing
Sharon Laskowski was interviewed about ballot design and voting technologies. 
She recommended contacting Michael Kerr of the Information Technology 
Association of America (ITAA) and John Borras of the Organization for the 
Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS). Both organizations 
have ballot manufacturers as members. 

Ms. Laskowski provided an update on usability, accessibility, and equipment 
standards to be included in 2007 VVSG updates. She also shared her expertise on 
usability testing, which informed subsequent phases of the research. 

Best practices in international ballot design
IFES houses an extensive collection of international ballots. This collection was 
reviewed to identify international best design practices, particularly those that 
address the needs of less literate voters.

Topic

Color

ID Findings

Conclusion

1 The collection used color extensively.

Use of color should be considered in U.S. ballots.

Photographs

2 Reproduction quality of candidate photographs was usually 
poor and the large amount of space used for candidate 
photographs was problematic.

Imagery may aid in candidate recognition if quality of 
photos and reproduction are both of high quality.

Party branding

3 Party branding was common, although political party icons 

used were not intuitive.

Political party icons were not intuitive, although they 
may be more relevant in a cultural context. Without clear 
meaning, icons added signiﬁ cant clutter to the ballots.

Language

4 Few of the ballots observed displayed more than one 

language.

5 Many countries have signiﬁ cantly less complicated ballots than 
the United States, sometimes consisting of a single race only. 
This difference makes it difﬁ cult to directly apply the same 
solutions.

Due to the complexity of U.S. ballots, adding icons and 
images to offer an image-based read of the ballot, as well 
as a text-based read, seems likely to only increase its 
length and complexity.

Best practices in design for low-literacy audiences
June Crawford of the National Institute for Literacy was interviewed about the 
use of graphics in ballots for low-literacy voters, and speciﬁ cally the conventional 
uses of political party icons, a common communication device geared toward 
low-literacy populations. Ms. Crawford also maintained that citizens with reading 
levels below third or fourth grade would require audio support to effectively 
vote with ballots. Although the team was not delivering audio design solutions, 
reading tools providing audio support were also examined. 

Topic

ID Finding

Conclusion

Simple language

1 Clear, direct, and simple language will make ballots easier to 

read and use than legal jargon.

Content 
distribution

2 An optimal print design would be a “booklet” depicting one 

contest per page with use of images, graphics, color, and large 
text.

As often as possible, isolate ideas to one per page. This can 
easily be applied to DRE solutions.

Comprehension

3 There are many successful interaction strategies used in 

software samples that could be leveraged to enhance the 
experience for those with minimal reading skills, for example, 
highlighted text to guide readers. 

Test highlighting on DRE prototypes to improve reading 
comprehension. 

Audio

4 Particularly when language is difﬁ cult, clear and consistent 

visual and interaction patterns and immediate conﬁ rmation of 
success or failure will reduce confusion.

Sound effects can reinforce interaction without adding 
visual overload. Work with manufacturers to understand and 
document realistic opportunities.

5 Audio is a useful aspect of design for those with low-literacy 

Audio controls should be offered throughout the experience.

skills, reinforcing words displayed and offering useful interaction 
feedback.

Minimal reading 
levels

6 All print materials should be usable by those with a third- or 

fourth-grade reading level. Materials targeting this educational 
level should be reviewed.

Use large type, short sentences, and paragraphs to reach 
those with low-literacy.

Usability testing

7 Reading challenges do not vary by location. Testing in particular 
geographic areas of the U.S. will not be necessary, although 
some areas may beneﬁ t more than others from improved 
design.

Next steps
Conduct research interviews with recommended experts: 

 —

Methodology
The contractor solicited translation proposals from two recommended 
organizations: Compass Languages and CTS Language link. Compass Languages 
was selected (as many elections vendors are) on the basis of price.

The partnership and content delivery process offered insights into speciﬁ c 
challenges facing ofﬁ cials with bilingual production requirements, such as ﬁ le-
sharing, formatting, font compatibility, stylistic consistency, delivery schedules, 
and turnaround times.

The templates and content delivery process provided insight into the production 
challenges experienced by election ofﬁ cials, including ﬁ le formats, font 
compatibility, typographic treatment, and turnaround time. 

Working with their current prototypes, the contractor translated several versions 
of one- and two-language optical scan ballots, nine rolling DRE ballot screens, and 
12 voter information pieces into Arabic, Chinese, and Vietnamese samples. These 
languages were chosen for their variety to challenge the ﬂ exibility of the design 
system.

Conclusion

Context

1 Context is critical to the quality of a translation. 

Translation companies need to see the materials in their 
designed form so that they can offer speciﬁ c and accurate 
translations.

Original materials

2 Materials should be crafted in simple English before being 

translated into other languages as this helps to ensure that the 
desired literacy level is achieved, regardless of language. 

The best practices document should offer planning tools

language before alternate language treatments.

Process and tools

3 The design templates provided were helpful despite 

compatibility issues when sharing ﬁ les between Mac and 
Windows versions of the same software. PDF ﬁ les were used 
to review and comment for each round of reﬁ nement.

To increase the likelihood of quality results, deﬁ ne a process 
and require tools with the translator that will allow rapid 
translations in the context of the ballot design and outside 
the heat of elections deadlines.

Typography

4 Recommended font families were not available in other 

languages. The translator needed to buy the fonts required for 
this project. Compass Languages worked with the contractor 
to identify and document appropriate font families, size, and 
weight requirements to ensure legibility across all languages.

Font

5 Treatment of typography is important to accurate translations; 
how text wraps and lines break will vary from one language to 
another and inﬂ uence the readability and meaning of content. 
During testing, it took at least two review cycles to produce 
adequate results.

It is essential that professional translators (preferably those 
with elections experience) are included in the process and 
given adequate time to translate. At least two rounds of 
reﬁ nement are likely to be necessary for quality translations.

Scalability and 
ﬂ exibility

6 Proposed single-language and dual-language ballots sufﬁ ciently 
accommodated the three languages and resulted in a relatively 
consistent design product.

Methodology
The contractor conducted three 60-minute usability sessions with three to four 
experts at a time to evaluate working prototypes against comparable materials. 
Feedback was captured in a standard format throughout all three sessions.

Participants examined core ballot prototypes and alternative studies to review 
issues of color use, icons, navigation, and treatment of long text in ballots for less 
literate voters.

Participants
The contractor met with 20 literacy instructors, each with an average teaching 
experience of 11 years.

General ﬁ ndings summary

Topic

ID Finding

Conclusion

Simple language

1 Users preferred “Yes” and “No” to “Accept” and “Reject” and 

“Next” and “Back” over “Forward” and “Previous.”

2 There is a need for simpler language on ballot measures.

Consider using shorter paragraphs. 

Consider adding extra space after commas or periods to 
provide visual break. 

Consider adding tick marks in left column or using line-
numbering conventions. 

Consider adding extra space between every ﬁ ve lines of 
text. 

3 The language used on the ballots was considered the main 

usability obstacle.

Offer ﬁ nal documents to simple language experts for review 
and input.

The literacy instructors initiated a list of words to be avoided 
and encouraged the development of a list of alternatives that 
would be included in the ﬁ nal document.

4 Experts preferred the use of words in addition to icons to label 

buttons.

Conclusion

Straight-party vote

1 Straight-party voting on the optical scan ballots was described 
as confusing even for experienced, engaged, and educated 
voters. 

Remove straight-party voting from optical scan ballots.

Ballot instructions

2 Illustrations shown on the optical scan ballot were considered 
useful but inaccurate. For example, the write-in instructions 
show a name in script while the text asks voters to print.

Conﬁ rm consistency of all instructions in the ballot. In this 
case, revise illustration.

Ballot instructions

3 Instructions were considered useful but the literacy instructors 
questioned the placement of the instructions in the left column, 
stating that it would be confusing to know where to begin 
voting. The “Start Voting Here” message was considered 
helpful but likely to be an insufﬁ cient cue, particularly for those 
with beginning reading skills. 

Show another version with instructions placed across the 
top of the ballot or on a cover sheet. Top-align contest titles 
(requested by voters in ﬁ rst round of usability testing) to 
increase readability, save space, and reduce costs. 

Voting instructions

4 Literacy instructors preferred the use of minimal color applied 

to instructions in other versions presented, stating that it draws 
attention to consistent and critical content without detracting 
from the visibility of candidate selection. 

Create two-color variations to further enhance clear 
instructions. 

Demonstrate a similar application of color on two-language 
ballots.

5 The exclamation point intended to draw attention to instructions 
may be overused. Instructors thought it would lose impact if 
used on every contest.

Reserve exclamation point for unique or important 
instructions.

Selection data

6 Instructors felt there should be greater distinction between 

contests and/or columns. 

Ideally, each contest would have a separate page with the 
title of each contest top-aligned to be most user friendly. 
Initial improvements should create greater clarity and visual 
hierarchy. 

Navigation

7 Instructors anticipated that voters will have difﬁ culty using the 
three-column format as currently designed. Early readers may 
attempt to read across the page rather than down columns 
unless there is greater distinction between columns. 

Explore design options to improve readability: vertical lines, 
alternating background shading in columns, expanding the 
space between columns, or providing stronger line breaks.

Informational 
icons

8 Symbols used in the ballot instructions (  ! ,  ? , or  i  ) were 

considered useful only as a visual cue.

Explore alternate informational characters and/or a 
numbering system to draw attention and provide necessary 
order and direction.

The question mark and the information symbol (  ?  and  i  ) 
were not considered intuitive and were culturally irrelevant for 
some. The exclamation point used to draw attention to special 
instructions was considered a symbol of urgency or danger but 
was also considered appropriate if minimally used. 

Political party 
icons

9 According to instructors, it will be difﬁ cult to design intuitive, 
simple political party icons that are descriptive enough for 
people to understand without instruction.

Remove political party icons or devote an entire research 
study to their meaningful development.

5 Voting instructions were easily visible. 

The prototype reﬁ nement should incorporate ballot

6 Placement and contrast was considered to be satisfactory for 

current prototype. 

Instructions should also be written with a patterned 
structure. “Vote for 1” and “Vote for up to 3” should follow 
similar sentence patterns.

Selection data

7 Instructors suggested adding a Skip button to provide 

conﬁ rmation when voters decide not to make a selection. 

Prototypes were designed to encourage voters to 
participate in all contests and therefore tend toward a 
relatively linear experience. This also simpliﬁ es instructions 
and navigation for users.

8 The current prototype does not allow users to skip a contest. 

Once they have made a selection, they are forced into a choice.

Ensure that all possible scenarios are noted and considered 
for documentation even though not all functionality will 
necessarily be included in a reﬁ ned prototype.

9 Instructors were confused by different instructions for “Select 

one” and “Select up to three” when trying to de-select a 
candidate because interaction patterns were different for each.

Consistently offer a tap on/tap off de-selection pattern. 
Toggle should also be active, offering two effective 
methods for changing a vote on single-selection contests.

11 Instructors thought the scroll bars, as currently designed, would 

be confusing for some.

Explore alternate pagination options. Add labels such as 
“See more” to scroll buttons.

12 Interaction patterns provided guidance and increased 

conﬁ dence; however, instructors were concerned that 
navigation did not offer enough consistency. 

Ensure that buttons are labeled, placed consistently, and 
behave consistently throughout the experience.

appropriate attention. 

Accessibility

14 The literacy instructors anticipated that some students, 

especially new citizens, will want to vote in English but may 
want or need to conﬁ rm information in their native language.

Offer the ability to change languages, contrast, and font size 
throughout the process.

Review/summary

Reﬁ ne the review/summary pages.

15 Some instructors requested immediate and more information 
telling them: (1) If they have skipped a contest; (2) If so, which 
one; (3) How to get back to areas of the ballot they may have 
missed; and (4) How much of the ballot and what type of 
contests are left.

The literacy instructors said novice readers often feel rushed 
and skip to more easily understood items. Patterns are very 
important in providing guidance and increasing conﬁ dence.

Offer access to review/summary pages throughout the 
voting experience. 

Consider allowing users to move through ballot sequentially

Conclusion

General ballot

1 Some State statutes prohibit the use of color. Color printing is 

also anticipated to be expensive for some jurisdictions.

The contractor recommends two colors for optimal 
readability and usability. The two-color solution can be 
translated to a one-color version. 

2 One expert questioned the technical feasibility of breaking long 

(ballot measure) text across two columns.

Studies showed that two-column display is optimal for 
voters and the contractor believes that existing vendor 
technology can accommodate this display.

3 Some States, such as California, require vote marks to be 
displayed to the right of candidate names, not to the left.

Place vote marks to the left as per typical convention for 
form design.

4 Will Western symbols, such as the exclamation point and 

question mark, be universally understood?

Symbols are not used without corresponding text 
explanation. Even if not understood, they serve as visual 
emphasis and help draw the voter’s attention to important 
information. 

5 The exclamation point is considered a warning instead of a 

symbol to draw attention to positive information.

Based on feedback from low-literacy experts, the 
exclamation point should be used on a limited basis.

6 Some state laws require the use of speciﬁ c fonts.

The Univers font family was designed to be extremely 
ﬂ exible and legible—the usability studies have conﬁ rmed its 
readability. Very similar sans serif faces may be as effective.

7 Use initial caps in “Vote for __” instructions. 

Make change: Use initial caps consistently. 

Can “all-caps” instructions be used?

8 Some jurisdictions require tear-off stubs on ballots.

9 Some areas require additional information about the candidate 

on the ballot—for example, three-word occupational 
descriptions.

All-caps treatments were not recommended in Design for 
Democracy’s and NIST’s “2005 Ballot Design Guidance” 
document. Numerous studies support the use of upper- and 
lowercase text settings over all capital settings. 

Ballot requirements vary greatly across the country. 
A general 80-20 majority favoring nonlinear formats was 
followed.

Content on the ballot should be kept to a minimum, offering 
only critical information to support ballot clarity. Additional 
candidate data (occupation, address, etc.) should be 
separate from the ballot and available to voters in advance of 
Election Day.

Ballot instructions

10 Instructions should say, “Use only the pencil provided,” or 

similar tone and content.

Make sure instructions are speciﬁ c and keyed to ballot 
technology.

11 Current write-in instructions state “Print name,” but the 

illustration displays a name written in script.

Conﬁ rm consistency of all instructions in the ballot. In this 
case, revise illustration.

12 According to one expert, including label “write-in” next to input 
ﬁ elds causes overvoting, even when de-emphasized in gray 
text.

Clarify write-in as an option, not a requirement.

13 Numbering instructions incorrectly implies a process although 

the “steps” are not actually sequential.

Keep instructions scannable; consider removing numbers 
for clarity.

Strive to keep the number of pages to a minimum while not 
breaking a contest or question onto another page.

The contractor recognizes that most manufacturers offer 
different ballot lengths and that ofﬁ cials have budget 
restrictions. By prioritizing minimum VVSG-required text 
sizes and navigational cues, voter usability is emphasized.

differentiating English and a second language in bold/plain text; 
it may actually be a legal requirement to present both languages 
in an identical manner.

While this simpliﬁ es the ballot, it also puts the onus on 
election ofﬁ cials and voters to have dialogs about this 
information before Election Day.

Simple-language experts edited the NIST-based instructions 
and labeling. Variables such as constitutional questions 
were not reviewed but continue to pose a core usability 
problem for participants in the studies.

When necessary, use the two-language template, 
developed with the support of literacy experts. This 
template uses bold text to distinguish one language from 
another when they share an alphabet (such as English and 
Spanish). 

No bold text is required, however, when alphabets differ 
(such as English and Chinese).

English does not need to be the ﬁ rst language in the 
sequence.

33 Political party names must be translated.

Implement this change.

34 The samples sent to the Language Working Group Asian 

representative did not include an Asian-language translation.

Materials were sent to AIGA China for a review and a 
second pass at translations. These ﬁ nal materials are used 
in the best practices document.

35 On two-language ballots, one expert suggested stacking 

languages horizontally rather than side-by-side.

This treatment was used successfully in the Colfax County, 
NE, pilot study, but testing with literacy experts indicated a 
preference for side-by-side display.

19 Participants got lost when moving between Selection, Review, 

and Help screens.

20 Few (3 of 25) noticed the progress indicator in its current 

placement, but once it was brought to users’ attention, they 
found it helpful.

Consider offering only the contest selected from Review 
page and forcing voters back to Review screen. This has 
pros and cons. Make navigation within the prototype more 
intuitive. Improve the scrolling pace.

Move the progress indicator so that Next and Back look 
more like an integrated unit. Label contest titles with screen 
number/count or provide more visual indicator of placement 
within ballot (i.e., an actual progress bar or thermometer-like 
visual). Also consider adding titles that reference contests, 
retentions, referendums at national, State, local levels.

21 Participants were confused about where to touch on the Next/

Previous buttons. A number suggested that the buttons should 
be shorter (arrow closer to label).

Adjust button length and typography to present as a more 
integrated unit and reduce unnecessary use of space.

22 Six of the ﬁ fteen people tested were confused by the scroll 
bars. Either they didn’t see them, didn’t know how they 
worked, or the scroll bars did not function as they expected. 

Reevaluate the functionality, placement, and visual 
appearance of scroll bars. Also consider pagination models 
as an alternative.

23 Participants consistently requested better labeling to indicate 
that more text was available. Many did not notice incomplete 
text or scroll bars.

Revise text as follows: “A straight-party vote means you 
vote for everyone on this ballot in that party. You can also 
choose a straight-party vote and then choose a person 
running in another party for one or more ofﬁ ces. Your vote 
for that person will be counted instead of your party vote in 
that ofﬁ ce. To choose a straight-party vote, touch a party 
name. A checkmark will appear. You can undo your choice 
by touching the checkmark again. To change your vote, 
touch a different party. After you are done voting for party 
contests, remember to vote for judges and ballot measures 
beginning on screen 17.”

41 Some participants thought they would be done with the voting 

process if they used the straight-party option. 

Draw attention to measures. Add an instructional paragraph 
that addresses this issue and place the Attention icon 
nearby to add emphasis.

42 Some users wanted to change languages midstream but 

couldn’t use the “Previous” button to do so.

Consider making settings adjustments available on each 
page.

Help

43 Instructions for how to change languages were not 

necessary—the touchscreen functionality should make the 
process obvious.

Remove term “Touch language below” and add English as 
an option.

the experience. Some thought they were voting when they 
were in help mode, and some didn’t notice when they moved 
from help back to the ballot. 

Change background color to be different than contest/
selection pages.

45 The left navigation was confusing for some participants. 

Restructure content hierarchy and revise button layout.

Some users indicated that the labeling/organization of content 
could be simpliﬁ ed.

46 Most participants thought three text sizes were unnecessary 

and recommended large and small. 

Offer two text sizes that meet 2005 VVSG standards and 
address issues of low vision or tunnel vision.

Summary

47 Many users appreciated the idea of a review screen, but few 

felt it met their expectations of a summary view.

Selected candidate name and party should be displayed in 
the center column with the Change My Vote button to its 
right for a more concise use of space.

A number of people commented on the poor use of space and 
stated that for a summary it didn’t feel very summarized.

48 Participants commonly requested easy access to the contest or 

screen they had previously visited. 

Allow users to navigate back to previous contest or help 
screens.

49 Participants had difﬁ culty understanding their next step after 

moving from the summary screen to a contest screen—many 
wanted to return to a summary page to pick up where they left 
off. 

50 Summary page is missing instructions.

Consider showing only the selected contest in isolation 
when coming from the summary page.

On a selected contest, remove all bottom navigation except 
“Help” and “Return to Summary” when coming from 
summary page.

Add instructions and summary at the top of the page and a

It was not understood whether they were voting or reviewing.

Add category titles as introduced on selection pages,

Note: These participants usually mentioned the font selection 
as part of the problem; and Univers (the recommended font) 
was not displayed as designed in all cases.

Simple language

57 “Vote for one” language sounds like a command and doesn’t 

imply that users have the opportunity to skip. Instructions need 
to make this clear.

Have simple-language experts review materials for ﬁ nal 
approval to ensure ease and accuracy given ﬁ nal prototype.

58 Referendums were stressful and difﬁ cult for everyone to read. 

“If we can’t understand them, how can design help?”

Consider a white or lighter gray background to make text 
easier to read. Increase leading. Add note in instructions

Ballot measures appeared “very gray” (not enough contrast).

long ballot measure screens.

Consider adding a tab structure as a possible means of

16 Expert quote: “I strongly recommend that the settings be 
separated from Help and provided in two places: before 
voting—on the ‘Choose language’ screen, perhaps—as well

Design development

Optical scan ballot

Optical scan ballots
Possible solutions for improvement of optical scan ballots for low-literacy voters are 
shown on pages 7.46–7.50. The process was iterative, with each successive design 
revised based on user input. Techniques to aid low-literacy voters include:

 —

Using color to support usability

 —

Using icons to support usability

 —

Displaying content (especially ballot measures) in two languages simultaneously

 —

Visually aligning contests and instructions.

Color studies
With domestic and international precedents for using color on ballots, options 
were tested that used color to improve usability—speciﬁ cally, to emphasize and 
clarify ballot instructions. ADA-compliant colors were used.

Icon studies
Due to the popularity of adding party icons to ballots in some U.S. jurisdictions, 
party icons were integrated into several samples and reviewed. Literacy and 
design experts agreed that the beneﬁ ts of potentially identiﬁ able party images 
(always coupled with party names) were outweighed by the extra visual, cognitive, 
and political information demands required for voter understanding.

Ballot measures and multiple-language studies
To clarify the usability of two-language ballots, especially in ballot measure 
content, the contractor examined variations in text layout, line length, text line 
spacing, and sequencing of content. Font weights and sizes were also studied to 
reinforce the readability of two languages and different alphabets.

Shall there be an amendment to the 
State constitution allowing the State 
legislature to enact laws limiting the 
amount of damages for noneconomic 
loss that could be awarded for 
injury or death caused by a health 
care provider? “Noneconomic loss” 
generally includes, but is not limited 
to, losses such as pain and suffering, 
inconvenience, mental anguish, loss 
of capacity for enjoyment of life, loss 
of consortium, and other losses the 
claimant is entitled to recover as 
damages under general law.

This amendment will not in any 
way affect the recovery of damages 
for ecomonic loss under State law. 
“Economic loss” generally includes, 
but is not limited to, monetary losses 
such as past and future medical 
expenses, loss of past and future 
earnings, loss of use of property, 
costs of repair or replacement, the 
economic value of domestic services, 
loss of employment or business 
opportunities. This amendment will 
not in any way affect the recovery of 
any additional damages known under 
State law as exemplary or punitive 
damages, which are damages 
allowed by law to punish a defendant 
and to deter persons from engaging 
in similar conduct in the future.

¿Habrá una enmienda a la constitución 
del Estado que permite el poder 
legislativo del estado para decretar las 
leyes que limitan la cantidad de daños 
para la pérdida de noneconomic que 
podría ser concedido para la herida o 
la muerte causadas por un proveedor 
de asistencia médica? La “pérdida de 
Noneconomic” incluye generalmente, 
pero no es limitada a, las pérdidas 
tales como el dolor y el sufrimiento, el 
inconveniente, la angustia mental, la 
pérdida de la capacidad para el placer 
de la vida, la pérdida de consorcio, y de 
otras pérdidas que el demandante tiene 
derecho para recuperar como daños bajo 
la ley general. Esta enmienda hace no en 
ninguna manera afecta la recuperación 
de daños para la pérdida de ecomonic 
bajo la ley del Estado. La “pérdida 
económica” incluye generalmente, pero 
no es limitada a, las pérdidas monetarias 
tales como el pasado y los gastos 
médicos futuros, la pérdida del pasado y 
ganancias futuras, la pérdida del uso de 
la propiedad, los costos de la reparación 
o el reemplazo, el valor económico de 
servicios domésticos, la pérdida de 
oportunidades de empleo o negocio. 
Esta enmienda hace no en ninguna 
manera afecta la recuperación de ningún 
daño adicional conocido bajo la ley del 
Estado los daños como ejemplares ni 
punitivos, que son los daños permitidos 
por la ley para castigar a un acusado y 
para disuadir a personas de entrar en el 
conducto semejante en el futuro.

Shall there be an amendment to 
the State constitution authorizing 
Madison and Fromwit Counties 
to hold referenda on whether to 
authorize slot machines in existing, 
licensed parimutuel facilities 
(thoroughbred and harness racing, 
greyhound racing, and jai alai) 
that have conducted live racing or 
games in that county during each of 
the last two calendar years before 
effective date of this amendment? 
The Legislature may tax slot machine 
revenues, and any such taxes must 
supplement public education 
funding statewide. Requires 
implementing legislation.

This amendment alone has no 
ﬁscal impact on government. If slot 
machines are authorized in Madison 
or Fromwit counties, governmental 
costs associated with additional 
gambling will increase by an 
unknown amount and local sales 
tax-related revenues will be reduced 
by $5 milliion to $8 million annually. 
If the Legislature also chooses to 
tax slot machine revenues, state tax 
revenues from Madison and Fromwit 
counties combined would range 
from $200 million to $500 million 
annually.

¿Habrá una enmienda a la constitución 
del Estado que autoriza Madison y

Shall there be an amendment to 
the State constitution authorizing 
Madison and Fromwit Counties 
to hold referenda on whether to 
authorize slot machines in existing, 
licensed parimutuel facilities 
(thoroughbred and harness racing, 
greyhound racing, and jai alai) 
that have conducted live racing or 
games in that county during each of 
the last two calendar years before 
effective date of this amendment? 
The Legislature may tax slot machine 
revenues, and any such taxes must 
supplement public education 
funding statewide. Requires 
implementing legislation.

This amendment alone has no 
ﬁscal impact on government. If slot 
machines are authorized in Madison 
or Fromwit counties, governmental 
costs associated with additional 
gambling will increase by an 
unknown amount and local sales 
tax-related revenues will be reduced 
by $5 milliion to $8 million annually. 
If the Legislature also chooses to 
tax slot machine revenues, state tax 
revenues from Madison and Fromwit 
counties combined would range 
from $200 million to $500 million 
annually.

Shall there be an amendment to the State constitution allowing the 
State legislature to enact laws limiting the amount of damages for 
noneconomic loss that could be awarded for injury or death caused by 
a health care provider?

“Noneconomic loss” generally includes, but is not limited to, losses 
such as pain and suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, loss of 
capacity for enjoyment of life, loss of consortium, and other losses 
the claimant is entitled to recover as damages under general law. This 
amendment will not in any way affect the recovery of damages for 
ecomonic loss under State law. “Economic loss” generally includes, 
but is not limited to, monetary losses such as past and future medical 
expenses, loss of past and future earnings, loss of use of property, 
costs of repair or replacement, the economic value of domestic 
services, loss of employment or business opportunities. This 
amendment will not in any way affect the recovery of any additional 
damages known under State law as exemplary or punitive damages, 
which are damages allowed by law to punish a defendant and to deter 
persons from engaging in similar conduct in the future.

Proposed Constitutional Amendment K:  
Slot Machines in Madison/Fromwit Counties

Shall there be an amendment to the State constitution authorizing 
Madison and Fromwit Counties to hold referenda on whether to 
authorize slot machines in existing, licensed parimutuel facilities 
(thoroughbred and harness racing, greyhound racing, and jai alai) that 
have conducted live racing or games in that county during each of the 
last two calendar years before effective date of this amendment?

The Legislature may tax slot machine revenues, and any such taxes 
must supplement public education funding statewide. Requires 
implementing legislation. This amendment alone has no ﬁscal impact 
on government. If slot machines are authorized in Madison or Fromwit 
counties, governmental costs associated with additional gambling will 
increase by an unknown amount and local sales tax-related revenues 
will be reduced by $5 milliion to $8 million annually. If the Legislature 
also chooses to tax slot machine revenues, state tax revenues from 
Madison and Fromwit counties combined would range from $200 
million to $500 million annually.

Ballot Measure 101: Open Primaries

Requires primary elections where voters may vote for any state or 
federal candidate regardless of party registration of voter or candidate. 
The two primary-election candidates receiving most votes for an 
ofﬁce, whether they are candidates with no party or members of 
same or different party, would be listed on general election ballot. 
Exempts presidential nominations. Fiscal Impact: No signiﬁcant net 
ﬁscal effect on state and local governments.

Ballot Measure 111:  
Revenue Bonds for Renovation of Madison County Jail Facilities

Directs the Madison County Public Safety Authority, a building 
authority incorporated by Madison County and the City of Ijamsville 
pursuant to Section 346.27 of the State Code, for the purpose of 
acquiring, destroying, demolishing, improving, enlarging, equipping, 
furnishing, repairing, maintaining and operating one or more public 
buildings for the joint use of the County, the City or any school district 
which is part of the County, to issue its revenue bonds in an amount 
not exceeding $29,700,000 for the purpose of acquiring, constructing, 
furnishing, equipping, renovating and expanding existing jail facilities 
for the joint use of the County and the City.

Ballot Measure 114: Financing for Mass Transit

Shall regional transportation district taxes be increased $158.34 million 
annually and by whatever additional amounts are raised annually 
thereafter by increasing the rate of sales tax levied by the district by 
four-tenths of one percent, from the current six-tenths of one percent 
to one percent commencing January 1, 2005 and, in connection 
therewith, shall regional transportation district debt be increased 
$3.477 billion, with a repayment cost of $7.129 billion with all proceeds 
of debt and taxes to be used and spent for the construction and 
operation of a ﬁxed guide way mass transit system, the construction 
of additional park-n-ride lots, the expansion and improvement of 
existing park-n-ride lots, and increased bus service, including the use 
of smaller buses and vans and alternative fuel vehicles as appropriate, 
as speciﬁed in the transit expansion plan adopted by the board of 
directors of the district on or before April 22, 2004 and shall debt be 
evidenced by bonds, notes, or other multiple-ﬁscal year obligations 
including refunding bonds that may be issued as a lower or higher 
rate of interest and including debt that may have a redemption prior 
to maturity with or without payment of a premium, payable from all 
revenues generated by said tax increase, federal funds, investment 
income, public and private contributions, and other revenues as the 
board may determine, and with such revenues raised by the sales tax 
rate increase and the proceeds of debt obligations and any investment 
income on such revenues and proceeds being exempt from the 
revenue and spending restrictions contained in section 20 of Article 
X of the State constitution until such time as all debt is repaid when 
the rate of tax will be decreased to that amount necessary for the 
continued operation of the system but not less than six-tenths of one 
percent?”

Proposed Constitutional Amendment K:  
Slot Machines in Madison/Fromwit Counties

Vote to accept or reject

Shall there be an amendment to the State constitution authorizing 
Madison and Fromwit Counties to hold referenda on whether to 
authorize slot machines in existing, licensed parimutuel facilities 
(thoroughbred and harness racing, greyhound racing, and jai alai) that 
have conducted live racing or games in that county during each of the 
last two calendar years before effective date of this amendment?

The Legislature may tax slot machine revenues, and any such taxes 
must supplement public education funding statewide. Requires 
implementing legislation. This amendment alone has no ﬁscal impact 
on government. If slot machines are authorized in Madison or Fromwit 
counties, governmental costs associated with additional gambling will 
increase by an unknown amount and local sales tax-related revenues 
will be reduced by $5 milliion to $8 million annually. If the Legislature 
also chooses to tax slot machine revenues, state tax revenues from 
Madison and Fromwit counties combined would range from $200 
million to $500 million annually.

Ballot Measure 101: Open Primaries

Vote to accept or reject

Exempts presidential nominations. Fiscal Impact: No signiﬁcant net 
ﬁscal effect on state and local governments.

Shall state taxes be increased $175 million annually through 
additional tobacco taxes imposed for health related purposes, and, 
in connection therewith, amending the State constitution to increase 
statewide taxes on the sale of cigarettes by wholesalers of three and 
two-tenths cents per cigarette and on the sale, use, consumption, 
handling, or distribution of other tobacco products by distributors at 
the rate of twenty percent of the manufacturer’s list price; increasing 
such tobacco taxes effective January 1, 2005; requiring annual 
appropriations of speciﬁ ed percentages of the additional tobacco 
tax revenues to expand eligibility for and increase enrollment in the 
children’s basic health plan, to fund comprehensive primary medical 
care through certain State qualiﬁ ed providers, tobacco education 
programs, and prevention, early detection, and treatment of cancer 
and cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, to compensate the state 
general fund, the old age pension fund, and local governments for 
tobacco tax losses resulting from reduced sales of cigarettes and 
tobacco products; specifying that the appropriations of additional 
tobacco tax revenues shall be in addition to and not substituted for 
appropriations for such programs on January 1, 2005; allowing the use 
of additional tobacco tax revenues for any health related purpose and 
to serve populations enrolled in the children’s basic health plan and 
the state medical assistance program as of January 1, 2005, upon a 
declaration of a state ﬁ scal emergency by two-thirds of the members 
of each house of the general assembly and the governor; prohibiting 
the repeal or reduction of existing taxes imposed on cigarettes and 
other tobacco products; excluding all additional tobacco tax revenues 
from ﬁ scal year spending for purposes of section 20 of Article X of 
the State constitution; and exempting appropriations of additional 
tobacco tax revenues from the statutory limitation on general fund

by a failure to construct an improvement in a good and workmanlike 
manner; deﬁ ning “good and workmanlike manner” to include 
construction that is suitable for its intended purposes; and permitting

Shall there be an amendment to the State constitution allowing the 
State legislature to enact laws limiting the amount of damages for 
noneconomic loss that could be awarded for injury or death caused by 
a health care provider?

“Noneconomic loss” generally includes, but is not limited to, losses 
such as pain and suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, loss of 
capacity for enjoyment of life, loss of consortium, and other losses 
the claimant is entitled to recover as damages under general law. This 
amendment will not in any way affect the recovery of damages for 
ecomonic loss under State law. “Economic loss” generally includes,

expenses, loss of past and future earnings, loss of use of property, 
costs of repair or replacement, the economic value of domestic 
services, loss of employment or business opportunities. This

Reviewing the ballot
Usability studies indicated that voters generally prefer to monitor their ballot 
completion progress while voting. Some participants requested the ability 
to (knowingly) skip ahead to decisions they deemed most important. Review 
screens should allow voters to accomplish both by offering an in-progress ballot 
summary and nonlinear access to contests and measures. Design iterations and 
usability testing explored navigational ﬂ ows connecting voting, reviewing,

About AIGA / Design for Democracy

About AIGA
AIGA, the professional association for design, is the oldest and largest 
membership association for design professionals engaged in the discipline, 
practice, and culture of designing. Its mission is to advance designing as a 
professional craft, strategic tool, and vital cultural force. 

The organization was founded as the American Institute of Graphic Arts in 
1914. Since then, it has become the preeminent professional association for 
communication designers, broadly deﬁ ned. In the past decade, designers have 
increasingly been involved in creating value for clients (whether public or business) 
through applying design thinking to complex problems, even when the outcomes 
may be more strategic, multidimensional, and conceptual than what most would 
consider traditional communication design. AIGA now represents more than 
19,000 designers of all disciplines through national activities and local programs 
developed by more than 55 chapters and 200 student groups. 

AIGA supports the interests of professionals, educators, and students who are 
engaged in the process of designing. The association is committed to stimulating 
thinking about design, demonstrating the value of design, and empowering 
success for designers throughout the arc of their careers. Through conferences, 
competitions, exhibitions, publications, and Web sites, AIGA inspires, educates, 
and informs designers, helping them to realize their talents and to advocate the 
value of design among the media, the business community, governments, and the 
public. 

About Design for Democracy
Design for Democracy is a strategic initiative of AIGA. The organization’s goal is to 
increase civic participation by making experiences clearer, more understandable, 
easier to accomplish, and more trustworthy. Design and social research 
professionals collaborate to enable compelling, efﬁ cient, and trust-building 
experiences between government and the governed.
